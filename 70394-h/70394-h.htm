<hr class="tiny">

<p class="nind space-above15"><span class="sc">Some</span> of the
chapters in this book have appeared as articles in ‘Blackwood’s
Magazine.’ The various journeys here recorded have been made in the
ordinary course of the work of inspection, and have been reported
in the usual official manner. These less technical descriptions
have been written in leisure hours, and the illustrations here
published are selected from a large number of photographs and
drawings rapidly made by the wayside. The journey to Wady Hammamât
and Kossair was made in the company of three painters, Mr Charles
Whymper, Mr Walter Tyndale, and Mr Erskine Nicol, to whom my thanks
are due, as also they are to Mr John Wells, with whom I travelled
to Gebel Dukhân. I am indebted to Prof. Sayce and Mr Seymour de
Ricci for several notes on the Greek inscriptions<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span> at Wady Abâd. On some of the
journeys I was accompanied by Mahmoud Effendi Rushdy and Mahmoud
Effendi Muhammed, Inspectors of the Department of Antiquities,
whose assistance was valuable.</p>

THE EASTERN DESERT AND ITS INTERESTS.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">I know</span> a young man who
declares that after reading a certain explorer’s description of a
journey across the burning Sahara, he found to his amazement that
his nose was covered with freckles. The reader will perhaps
remember how, on some rainy day in his childhood, he has sat over
the fire and has read sea-stories and dreamed sea-dreams until his
lips, he will swear, have tasted salt. Alas, one’s little agility
in the art of narration is wholly inadequate for the production, at
this time of life, of any such phenomena upon the gentle skins of
those who chance to read these pages. Were one a master-maker of
literature, one might herewith lead the imaginative so<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> straight into the boisterous
breezes of Egypt, one might hold them so entranced in the sunlight
which streams over the desert, that they would feel, wherever they
might be seated, the tingling glow of the sun and the wind upon
their cheeks, and would hold their hands to their eyes as a shelter
from the glare. The walls of their rooms would fall flat as those
of Jericho; and outside they would see the advancing host of the
invaders—the sunshine, the north wind, the scudding clouds, the
circling eagles, the glistening sand, the blue shadows, and the
rampant rocks. And the night closing over the sack of their city,
they would see the moonlight, the brilliant stars, the fluttering
bats, the solemn owls; and they would hear the wailing of the
hyænas and the barking of the dogs in the distant camps. If one
only possessed the ability, one might weave such a magic carpet for
those who knew how to ride upon it, that, deserting the fallen
Jericho of their habitation, they would fly to the land of the
invaders which they had seen, and there they would be kept as
spell-bound and dazzled by the eyes of the wilderness as ever a
child was dazzled by a tale of the sea.</p>

<p>But with this ability lacking it is very doubtful whether the
reader will be able to appreciate the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_3">[3]</span> writer’s meaning; and, without the carpet, it
is a far cry from Upper Egypt, where these words are written, to
the fireside where they are read. Nevertheless I will venture to
give an account here of some journeys made in the Upper Egyptian
desert, in the hope rather of arousing interest in a fascinating
country than of placing on record much information of value to
science; although the reader interested in Egyptian archæology will
find some new material upon which to speculate.</p>

<p>The Upper Egyptian desert is a country known only to a very few.
The resident, as well as the visitor, in Egypt raises his eyes from
the fertile valley of the Nile to the bare hills, and lowers them
once more with the feeling that he has looked at the wall of the
garden, the boundary of the land. There is, however, very much to
be seen and studied behind this wall; and those who penetrate into
the solitudes beyond will assuredly find themselves in a world of
new colours, new forms, and new interests. In the old days precious
metal was sought here, ornamental stone was quarried, trade-routes
passed through to the Red Sea, and the soldiery of Egypt, and later
of Rome, marched from station to station amidst its hills. The
desert as one sees it now is, so to speak, peopled with
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> ghosts of the Old
World; and on hidden hill-slopes or in obscure valleys one meets
with the remains of ancient settlements scattered through the
length and breadth of the country.</p>

<p>The number of persons who have had the energy to climb the
garden wall and to wander into this great wilderness is so small
that one might count the names upon the fingers. Lepsius, the
German Egyptologist, passed over some of the routes on which
antiquities were to be met with; Golénischeff, the Russian
Egyptologist, checked some of his results; Schweinfurth, the German
explorer, penetrated to many of the unknown localities, and mapped
a great part of the country; Bellefonds Bey, the Director-General
of Public Works in Egypt under Muhammed Aly, made a survey of the
mineral belt lying between the river and the Red Sea; and during
the last score of years various prospectors and miners have visited
certain points of interest to them. The Government Survey
Department is now engaged in mapping this Eastern Desert, and two
most valuable reports have already been published; while for a few
years there existed a Mines Department, whose director, Mr John
Wells, made himself acquainted with many of the routes and most of
the mining centres. Thus, most of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_5">[5]</span> the journeys here to be recorded have not been
made over absolutely new ground; though, except for the expert
reports of the Survey Department and some papers by Schweinfurth,
it would be a difficult matter to unearth any literature on the
subject. In describing these journeys, however, one is often
enabled to indulge in the not unpleasing recollection that one is
writing of places which no other European eyes have seen.</p>

<p>Those who have travelled in Egypt will not need to be told how
the Nile, flowing down from the Sudan to the distant sea, pushes
its silvery way through the wide desert: now passing between the
granite hills, now through regions of sandstone, and now under the
limestone cliffs. A strip of verdant cultivated land, seldom more
than six or eight miles wide, and often only as many yards, borders
the broad river; and beyond this, on either side, is the desert. In
Upper Egypt one may seldom take an afternoon’s ride due east or due
west without passing out either on to the sun-baked sand of a
limitless wilderness or into the liquid shadows of the towering
hills. For the present we are not concerned with the western
desert, which actually forms part of the great Sahara, and one’s
back may therefore be turned upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
</p>

<p>Eastwards, behind the hills or over the sand, there is in most
parts of the country a wide undulating plain, broken here and there
by the limestone outcrops. Here the sun beats down from a vast sky,
and the traveller feels himself but a fly crawling upon a brazen
table. In all directions the desert stretches, until, in a leaden
haze, the hot sand meets the hot sky. The hillocks and points of
rock rise like islands from the floods of the mirage in which they
are reflected; and sometimes there are clumps of withered bushes to
tell of the unreality of the waters.</p>

<p>The scenery here is often of exquisite beauty; and its very
monotony lends to it an interest when for a while the grouping of
the hills ceases to offer new pictures and new harmonies to the
eye. Setting out on a journey towards the Red Sea one rides on
camel-back over this rolling plain, with the sun bombarding one’s
helmet from above and the wind charging it from the flank; and, as
noonday approaches, one often looks in vain for a rock under which
to find shade. Naturally the glaring sand is far hotter than the
shady earth under the palms in the cultivation; but the stagnant,
dusty, fly-filled air of the groves is not to be compared with the
clear atmosphere up in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
the wilderness. There are no evil odours here, breeding sickness
and beckoning death. The wind blows so purely that one might think
it had not touched earth since the gods released it from the golden
caverns. The wide ocean itself has not less to appeal to the sense
of smell than has the fair desert.</p>

<p>Descending from the camel for lunch, one lies on one’s back upon
the sand and stares up at the deep blue of the sky and the intense
whiteness of a passing cloud. Raising oneself, the Nile valley may
still be seen, perhaps, with its palms floating above the vaporous
mirage; and away in the distance the pale cliffs rise. Then across
one’s range of sight a butterfly zigzags, blazing in the sunlight;
and behind it the blue becomes darker and the white more extreme.
Around one, on the face of the desert, there is a jumbled
collection of things beautiful: brown flints, white pebbles of
limestone, yellow fragments of sandstone, orange-coloured ochre,
transparent pieces of gypsum, carnelian and alabaster chips,
glittering quartz. Across the clear patches of sand there are all
manner of recent footprints, and the incidental study of these is
one of the richest delights of a desert journey. Here one may see
the four-pronged footprints of a wagtail, and there the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> larger marks of a crow. An eagle’s
and a vulture’s footmarks are often to be observed, and the
identification of those of birds such as the desert partridge or of
the cream-coloured courser is a happy exercise for one’s ingenuity.
Here the light, wiggly line of a lizard’s rapid tour abroad
attracts the attention, reminding one of some American
globe-trotter’s route over Europe; and there footprints of the
jerboa are seen leading in short jumps towards its hole. Jackals or
foxes leave their dainty pad-marks in all directions, and one may
sometimes come across the heavy prints of a hyæna, while it is not
unusual to meet with those of a gazelle.</p>

<p>In the afternoon one rides onwards, and perhaps a hazy view of
the granite hills may now be obtained in the far distance ahead.
The sun soon loses its strength, and shines in slanting lines over
the desert, so that one sees oneself in shadow stretched out to
amazing lengths, as though the magnetic power of night in the east
were already dragging in the reluctant darknesses to its dark self.
Each human or camel footprint in the sand is at this hour a basin
filled with blue shade, while every larger dent in the desert’s
surface is brimful of that same blue; and the colour is so opaque
that an Arab lying therein<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_9">[9]</span> clad in his blue shirt is almost
indistinguishable at a distance. Above one the white clouds go
tearing by, too busy, too intent, it would seem, on some far-off
goal to hover blushing around the sun. The light fades, and the
camp is pitched on the open plain; and now one is glad to wrap
oneself in a large overcoat, and to swallow the hot tea which has
been prepared over a fire of the dried scrub of the desert.</p>

<p>The nights in the desert are as beautiful as the days, though in
winter they are often bitterly cold. With the assistance of a warm
bed and plenty of blankets, however, one may sleep in the open in
comfort; and only those who have known this vast bedroom will
understand how beautiful night may be. If one turns to the east,
one may stare at Mars flashing red somewhere over Arabia, and
westwards there is Jupiter blazing above the Sahara. One looks up
and up at the expanse of star-strewn blue, and one’s mind journeys
of itself into the place of dreams before sleep has come to conduct
it thither. The dark desert drops beneath one; the bed floats in
mid-air, with planets above and below. Could one but peer over the
side, earth would be seen as small and vivid as the moon. But a
trance holds the body inactive, and the eyes are fixed upon
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span> space above.
Then, quietly, a puff of wind brings one down again to realities as
it passes from darkness to darkness. Consciousness returns quickly
and gently, points out the aspect of the night, indicates the
larger celestial bodies, and as quickly and gently leaves one again
to the tender whispers of sleep.</p>

<p>When there is moonlight there is more to carry the eye into the
region of dreams on earth than there is in the heavens; for the
desert spreads out around one in a silver, shimmering haze, and no
limit can be placed to its horizons. The eye cannot tell where the
sand meets the sky, nor can the mind know whether there is any
meeting. In the dimness of coming sleep one wonders whether the
hands of the sky are always just out of reach of those of the
desert, whether there is always another mile to journey and always
another hill to climb; and, wondering, one drifts into
unconsciousness. At dawn the light brings one back to earth in time
to see the sun pass up from behind the low hills. In contrast to
the vague night the proceeding is rapid and business-like. The
light precedes its monarch only by half an hour or so; and ere the
soft colours have been fully appreciated, the sun appears over the
rocks and flings a sharp<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_11">[11]</span> beam into the eyes of every living thing, so
that in a moment the camp is stirred and awakened.</p>

<p>During the second or third day’s ride one generally enters the
granite regions, and one is lost amidst the intricate valleys which
pass between the peaks of the hills. Here one may find plenty of
shelter from the sun’s rays in the shadow of the cliffs; and as the
camel jogs along over the hard gravel tracks, or as one sits for
refreshment with the back propped against a great grey boulder, the
view which is to be enjoyed is often magnificent. On the one side
the dark granite, porphyry, or breccia rocks rise up like the
towered and buttressed walls of some fairy-tale city; while on the
other side range rises behind range, and a thousand peaks harmonise
their delicate purples and greys with the blue of the sky. When the
sun sets these lofty peaks are flushed with pink, and, like
mediators between earth and heaven, carry to the dark valleys the
tale of a glory which one cannot see. There is usually plenty of
scrub to be found in the valleys with which to build the evening
fires, and with good luck one might replenish the food-supplies
with the tender flesh of the gazelle. Every two or three days one
may camp beside a well of pure water, where the camels<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> may drink, and from which the
portable tanks may be refilled.</p>

<p>Near these wells there are sometimes a few Bedwin to be found
tending their little herds of goats: quiet, harmless sons of the
desert, who generally own allegiance to some Shêkh living in the
Nile valley. One’s guides and camel-men exchange greetings with
them, and pass the latest news over the camp fires. Often, however,
one may journey for many days without meeting either a human being
or a four-footed animal, though on the well-marked tracks the
prints of goats and goatherds, camels and camel-men, are
apparent.</p>

<p>No matter in what direction one travels, hardly a day passes on
which one does not meet with some trace of ancient activity. Here
it will be a deserted gold-mine, there a quarry; here a ruined
fortress or town, and there an inscription upon the rocks.
Indications of the present day are often so lacking, and Time seems
to be so much at a standstill, that one slips back in imagination
to the dim elder days. The years fall from one like a garment
doffed, and one experiences a sense of relief from their weight. A
kind of exhilaration, moreover, goes with the thought of the life
of the men of thousands of years ago who lived amongst these
changeless hills and valleys. Their days were so<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> full of adventure: they were
beset with dangers. One has but to look at the fortified camps, the
watch-towers on the heights, the beacons along the highroads, to
realise how brave were the “olden times.” One of the peculiar
charms of these hills of the Eastern Desert is their impregnation
with the atmosphere of a shadowy adventurous past. One’s mind is
conscious, if it may be so expressed, of the ghosts of old sights,
the echoes of old sounds. Dead ambitions, dead terrors, drift
through these valleys on the wind, or lurk behind the tumbled
rocks. Rough inscriptions on these rocks tell how this captain or
that centurion here rested, and on the very spot the modern
traveller rests to ease the self-same aches and to enjoy the
self-same shade before moving on towards an identical goal in the
east.</p>

<p>On the third or fourth day after leaving the Nile one passes
beneath the mountains, which here rise sometimes to as much as 6000
feet; and beyond these the road slopes through the valleys down to
the barren Red Sea coast, which may be any distance from 100 to 400
miles from the Nile. Kossair is the one town on the coast opposite
Upper Egypt, as it was also in ancient times; and Berenice,
opposite Lower Nubia, was the only other town north of Sudan
territory. Kossair does a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_14">[14]</span> fast-diminishing trade with Arabia, and a
handful of Egyptian coastguards is kept mildly busy in the
prevention of smuggling. The few inhabitants of the Egyptian coast
fish, sleep, say their prayers, or dream in the shade of their
hovels until death at an extremely advanced age releases them from
the boredom of existence. Those of them who are of Arab stock
sometimes enliven their days by shooting one another in a more or
less sporting manner, and by wandering to other and more remote
settlements thereafter; but those of Egyptian blood have not the
energy even for this amount of exertion. There is a lethargy over
the desert which contrasts strangely with one’s own desire for
activity under the influence of the sun and the wind, and of the
records of ancient toil which are to be observed on all sides. It
must be that we of the present day come as the sons of a race still
in its youth; and in this silent land we meet only with the
worn-out remnant of a people who have been old these thousands of
years.</p>

<p>There was a threefold reason for the activities of the ancients
in the Eastern Desert. Firstly, from Koptos, a city on the Nile not
far from Thebes, to Kossair there ran the great trade-route with
Arabia, Persia, and India; from Suez to Koptos there was a route by
which the traders from Syria<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_15">[15]</span> often travelled; from Edfu to Berenice there
was a trade-route for the produce of Southern Arabia and the
ancient land of Pount; while other roads from point to point of the
Nile were often used as short-cuts. Secondly, in this desert there
were very numerous gold mines, the working of which was one of the
causes which made Egypt the richest country of the ancient world.
And thirdly, the ornamental stones which were to be quarried in the
hills were in continuous requisition for the buildings and statuary
of Egypt, Assyria, Persia, and Rome.</p>

<p>There is much to be said in regard to the gold-mining, but here
space will not permit of more than the most cursory review of the
information. Gold was used in Egypt at a date considerably prior to
the beginning of written history in Dynasty I., and there are many
archaic objects richly decorated with that metal. The situation of
many of the early cities of the Nile valley is due solely to this
industry. When two cities of high antiquity are in close proximity
to one another on opposite banks of the river, as is often the case
in Upper Egypt, one generally finds that the city on the western
bank is the older of the two. In the case of Diospolis Parva and
Khenoboskion, which stand opposite to one another, the former, on
the west bank, is the more ancient and is the capital<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> of the province, and the latter,
on the east bank, does not date earlier than Dynasty VI. Of Ombos
and Koptos, the former, on the west bank, has prehistoric
cemeteries around it; while the latter, on the east bank, dates
from Dynasty I. at the earliest. Hieraconpolis and Eileithyiapolis
stand opposite to each other, and the former, which is on the west
bank, is certainly the more ancient. Of Elephantine and Syene, the
latter, on the east bank, is by far the less ancient. And in the
case of Pselchis and Baki (Kubbân), the former, on the west bank,
has near it an archaic fortress; while the latter, on the east
bank, does not date earlier than Dynasty XII. The reason of this is
to be found in the fact that most of the early cities were engaged
in gold-mining, and despatched caravans into the Eastern Desert for
that purpose. These cities were usually built on the western bank
of the river, since the main routes of communication from end to
end of Egypt passed along the western desert. Mining stations had,
therefore, to be founded on the eastern bank opposite to the parent
cities; and these stations soon became cities themselves as large
as those on the western shore. Thus the antiquity of the eastern
city in each of these cases indicates at least that same antiquity
for the mining of gold.</p>

</p>

<p>Throughout what is known as the old kingdom, gold was used in
ever-increasing quantities, but an idea of the wealth of the mines
will best be obtained from the records of the Empire. About 250,000
grains of gold were drawn by the Vizir Rekhmara in taxes from Upper
Egypt, and this was but a small item in comparison with the taxes
levied in kind. A king of a north Syrian state wrote to Amonhotep
III., the Pharaoh of Egypt, asking for gold, and towards the end of
his letter he says: “Let my brother send gold in very large
quantities, without measure, and let him send more gold to me than
he did to my father; for in my brother’s land gold is as common as
dust.” To the god Amon alone Rameses III. presented some 26,000
grains of gold, and to the other gods he gave at the same time very
large sums. In later times the High Priest of Amon was made also
director of the gold mines, and it was the diverting of this vast
wealth from the crown to the church which was mainly responsible
for the fall of the Ramesside line.</p>

<p>A subject must here be introduced which will ever remain of
interest to the speculative. Some have thought that the southern
portion of this desert is to be identified with the Ophir of the
Bible, and that the old gold-workings here are<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_18">[18]</span> none other than “King Solomon’s Mines.” In
the Book of Kings one reads, “And King Solomon made a navy of ships
in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea,
in the land of Edom. And Hiram sent in the navy his servants,
shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of
Solomon. And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to King Solomon.” Ophir
cannot be identified with Arabia, since there is no gold there; and
hence one may seek this land of ancient wealth at the southern end
of the Eastern Egyptian Desert. If it is argued that the Hebrews
would have found difficulties in carrying on mining operations
unmolested in Egyptian territory, it may be contended on the other
hand that King Solomon may have made some bargain with the Pharaoh:
for example, that the former might mine in a certain tract of
desert if the latter might cut timber in the Lebanon. The purchase
of cedar-wood by the Egyptians is known to have taken place at
about this period, payment in gold being made; and therefore it
does not require an undue stretch of the imagination to suppose
that the Hebrews themselves mined the gold. Again, at the time when
King Solomon reigned in all his<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_19">[19]</span> glory in Palestine, the short-lived Pharaohs
of Egypt sat upon tottering thrones, and were wholly unable to
protect the Eastern Desert from invasion. The Egyptians often state
that they encountered hostile forces in this land, and these may
not always have consisted of Bedwin marauders.</p>

<p>No savant has accepted for a moment the various theories which
place Ophir at the southern end of the African continent; and the
most common view is that Solomon obtained his gold from the land of
Pount, so often referred to in Egyptian inscriptions. This country
is thought to have been situated in the neighbourhood of Suakin;
but, as Professor Naville points out, it is a somewhat vague
geographical term, and may include a large tract of country to the
north and south of this point. One cannot imagine the Hebrews
penetrating very far over the unknown seas to the perilous harbours
of Middle Africa: one pictures them more easily huddled in the less
dangerous ports of places such as Kossair or Berenice, or at
farthest in that of Suakin. It is thus quite probable that some of
the gold-workings in the desert here described are actually King
Solomon’s Mines, and that the country through which the reader will
be conducted is the wonderful Ophir<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_20">[20]</span> itself. Certainly there is no one who can
state conclusively that it is not.</p>

<p>Work continued with unabated energy during the later periods of
Egyptian history, and the Persian, Greek, and Roman treasuries were
filled consecutively with the produce of the mines. Several
classical writers make reference to these operations, and sometimes
one is told the actual name and situation of the workings. Diodorus
gives a description of the mines in the Wady Alagi, and tells how
the work was done. The miners wore a lamp tied to their forehead.
The stone was carried to the surface by children, and was pounded
in stone mortars by iron pestles. It was then ground to a fine
powder by old men and women. This powdered ore was washed on
inclined tables, the residue being placed in earthen crucibles with
lead, salt, and tin for fluxes, and was there baked for five days.
Agatharchides describes how the prisoners and negroes hewed out the
stone, and, with unutterable toil, crushed it in mills and washed
out the grains of gold. The Arabic historian, El Macrizi, states
that during the reign of Ahmed ben Teilun there was great activity
in the mining industry throughout the Eastern Desert, and Cufic
inscriptions of this date found in the old workings confirm this
statement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> From then,
until modern times, however, little work was done; but in recent
years, as the reader will no doubt know, many of the ancient
workings have been reopened, and one must admit that if these are
really to be regarded as King Solomon’s Mines, that potentate must
have had a somewhat lower opinion of Ophir than tradition
indicates.</p>

<p>The other cause for the ancient activity in the Eastern Desert
was, as has been said, the need of ornamental stone for the making
of vases, statues, and architectural accessories. From the earliest
times bowls and vases of alabaster, breccia, diorite, and other
fine stones were used by the Egyptians, and the quarries must have
already formed quite a flourishing industry. Soon the making of
statuettes, and later of statues, enlarged this industry, and with
the growth of civilisation it steadily increased. The galleries of
the Cairo Museum, and those of European museums, are massed with
statues and other objects cut in stone brought from the hills
between the Nile and the Red Sea. The breccia quarries of Wady
Hammamât were worked from archaic to Roman days; the Tourquoise
Mountains, not far from Kossair, supplied the markets of the
ancient world; white granite was taken from the hills of Um Etgal;
there were two or three alabaster quarries in constant<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> use; and in the time of the
Roman Empire the famous Imperial porphyry was quarried in the
mountains of Gebel Dukhân. One may still see blocks of breccia at
Hammamât, of granite at Um Etgal, or of porphyry at Dukhân, lying
abandoned at the foot of the hills, although numbered and actually
addressed to the Cæsars. The towns in which the quarrymen lived
still stand in defiance of the years, and the traveller who has the
energy to penetrate into the distant valleys where they are
situated may there walk through streets untrodden since the days of
Nero and Trajan, and yet still littered with the chippings from the
dressing of the blocks.</p>

<p>In the old days the provisioning of the mining and quarrying
settlements must have taxed the ingenuity even of the Egyptians;
and the establishing of workable lines of communication with the
distant Nile must have required the most careful organisation. The
caravans bringing food were of great size, for there were often
several thousands of hungry miners to be fed. In Dynasty VI. one
reads of 200 donkeys and 50 oxen being used in the transport, and
in Dynasty XI. 60,000 loaves of bread formed the daily requirements
in food of one expedition. In late Ramesside times the food of an
expedition of some 9000 men was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_23">[23]</span> carried on ten large carts, each drawn by six
yoke of oxen, while porters “innumerable” are said to have been
employed. The families of the workmen generally lived on the spot,
and these also had to be fed—a fact which is indicated, too, by an
inscription which states that in one expedition each miner required
twenty loaves of bread per diem.</p>

<p>Whenever this organisation broke down the consequences must have
been awful. In this quarrying expedition in Ramesside times,
consisting of 9000 men, 10 per cent of them died from one cause or
another; and later writers speak of the “horrors” of the mines. In
summer the heat is intense in the desert, and the wells could not
always have supplied sufficient water. The rocks are then so hot
that they cannot be touched by the bare hand, and one’s boots are
little protection to the feet. Standing in the sunlight, the ring
has to be removed from one’s finger, for the hot metal burns a
blister upon the flesh. After a few hours of exercise there is a
white lather upon the lips, and the eyes are blinded with the
moisture which has collected around them; and thus what the
quarrymen and miners must have suffered as they worked upon the
scorching stones no tongue can tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
</p>

<p>In ancient Egyptian times the camel was regarded as a curious
beast from a far country, and was seldom, if ever, put to any use
in Egypt. Only three or four representations of it are now known,
and it never occurs amongst any of the animals depicted upon the
walls of the tombs, although bears, elephants, giraffes, and other
foreign and rare creatures, are there shown. It was an Asiatic
animal, and was not introduced into Egypt as an agent of
transportation until the days of the ubiquitous Romans. Donkeys,
oxen, and human beings were alone used in Pharaonic days for
transporting the necessities of the labourers and the produce of
their work; and probably the officials were carried to and fro in
sedan-chairs. Even in Roman days there is nothing to show that the
camel was very largely employed, and one may not amuse oneself too
confidently with the picture of a centurion of the Empire astride
the hump of the rolling ship of the desert.</p>

<p>Nowadays, of course, one travels entirely by camel in the
desert. For an expedition of fifteen days or so one generally
requires about a dozen camels all told, and one or two guides. Some
of the animals carry the water in portable tanks; others are loaded
with the tents and beds; and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_25">[25]</span> others carry the boxes of tinned food and
bottled drinks. The whole caravan rattles and bumps as it passes
through the echoing valleys, and one’s cook rises from amidst a
clattering medley of saucepans and kettles which are slung around
his saddle. The camels are obtained, at the rate of two to three
shillings per diem, from some Shêkh, who holds himself more or less
responsible for one’s safety. With a steady steed and a good saddle
there are few means of locomotion so enjoyable as camel-riding.
Once the art is learnt it is never forgotten, and after the
tortures of the first day or so of the first expedition, one need
never again suffer from stiffness, though many months may elapse
between the journeys. This preliminary suffering is due to one’s
inability at the outset to adjust the muscles to the peculiar
motion; but the knowledge comes unconsciously after a while and
ever remains.</p>

<p>One jogs along at the rate of about four and a half or five
miles an hour, and some thirty miles a-day is covered with ease.
The baggage camels travel at about three miles an hour. They start
first, are passed during the morning, catch one up at the long rest
for luncheon, are again passed during the afternoon, and arrive
about an hour after the halt has been called. If possible,
all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> the camels drink
every second day, but they are quite capable of going strongly for
three or four days without water, and, when really necessary, can
travel for a week or more through a land without wells.</p>

<p>While the Mines Department was in existence experiments were
tried with automobiles and motor bicycles, which were by no means
unsuccessful. Many of the main roads in the Eastern Desert pass
over hard gravel, and a motor may be driven with safety over the
unprepared camel tracks. If wells were sunk every ten or fifteen
miles, there would be no dangers to be feared from a breakdown; and
under favourable circumstances the journey from the Nile to the Red
Sea might be accomplished in a morning. In the future one may
picture the energetic tourist leaving his Luxor or Cairo hotel,
whirling over the open plains where now one crawls, rushing through
the valleys in which the camel-rider lingers, penetrating to the
remote ruins and deserted workings, and emerging breathless on to
the golden coast of the sea, to wave his handkerchief to his
friends upon the decks of the Indian liners.</p>

<p>The time must surely come when the owners of automobiles in
Egypt will sicken of the short roads around Cairo, and will venture
beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> garden
wall towards the rising sun. Whether it will be that the re-working
of the gold mines and the quarries of ornamental stone will attract
the attention of these persons to this wonderful wilderness, or
that the enterprising automobilists will pave the way for the
miners and the quarrymen, it is certain that some day the desert
will blossom with the rose once more, and the rocks reverberate
with the sound of many voices. Had I now in my two open hands
pearls, diamonds, and rubies, how gladly would I give them—or some
of them—for the sight of the misty mountains of the Eastern Desert,
and for the feel of the sharp air of the hills! One looks forward
with enthusiasm to the next visit to these unknown regions, and one
cannot but feel that those who have it in their power to travel
there are missing much in remaining within the walls of the little
garden of the Nile. One hears in imagination the camels grunting as
their saddles are adjusted; one feels the tingle of the morning
air; and one itches to be off again, “over the hills and far away,”
into the solitary splendour of the desert.</p>

<h2><a id="c2"></a>II.<br>
TO THE QUARRIES OF WADY HAMMAMÂT.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> so-called Breccia
Quarries of Wady Hammamât are known to all Egyptologists by name,
owing to the important historical inscriptions which are cut on the
rocks of the valley. In reality the stone quarried there was mainly
tuff, or consolidated volcanic ash; and the real name of the
locality is Wady Fowakhîeh, “the Valley of the Pots”; but such
niceties do not trouble the average archæologist. Many of the
inscriptions were copied by Lepsius, the late German Egyptologist,
and further notes were made by Golénischeff, a Russian savant; but
except for these two persons no Egyptologist has studied the
quarries. They have been seen, however, on a few occasions by
Europeans; and, as the caravan road to Kossair passes along the
valley in which they are situated, they are known to all the
natives who have crossed the desert at this point. In November 1907
I found it possible to visit this historic<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_29">[29]</span> site, and I was fortunate enough to obtain
the companionship of three English friends who happened, very
opportunely, to be in search of mild excitement at the time.</p>

<p>We set out from Luxor one morning in November, our caravan
consisting in all of twenty-three camels, nine of which were ridden
by our four selves, my servant, two guards, the Shêkh of the
camelmen, and the guide, while fourteen were loaded with the three
tents, the baggage, and the water-tanks, and were tended by a dozen
camelmen who made the journey mainly on foot. Our road led
eastwards from Luxor past the temple of the goddess Mut at Karnak,
reflected in its sacred lake, and so along the highroad towards the
rising sun. The day was cool, and a strong invigorating breeze
raced past us, going in the same direction. Before us, as we
crossed the fields, the sunlit desert lay stretched behind the soft
green of the tamarisks which border its edge. Away to the right the
three peaks of the limestone hills, which form the characteristic
background of Thebes, rose into the sunlight; and to the left one
could discern the distant ranges behind which we were to
penetrate.</p>

<p>On reaching the desert we turned off northwards towards these
hills, skirting the edge of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_30">[30]</span> cultivated land until we should pick up the
ancient road which leaves the Nile valley some twenty miles north
of Luxor. After luncheon and a rest in the shade of the rustling
tamarisks the ride was continued, and we did not again dismount
until, in the mid-afternoon, the Coptic monastery which is situated
behind the town of Qus, and which marks the beginning of the road
to the Red Sea, was reached; and here the camp was pitched. The
quiet five-hours’ ride of about twenty miles had sufficed to
produce healthy appetites in the party, and, when the sun went down
and the air turned cold, we were glad to attack an early dinner in
the warmth of the mess-tent—one of the camel-boxes serving as a
table, and the four saddles taking the place of chairs.</p>

<p>The next morning we set out soon after sunrise, and rode
eastwards into the desert, which here stretched out before us in a
blaze of sunlight. The road passed over the open gravel and sand in
a series of parallel tracks beaten hard by the pads of generations
of camels. Gebel el Gorn, “the Hill of the Horn,” was passed before
noon; and, mounting a ridge, we saw the wide plain across which we
were to travel, intersected by a dry river-bed marked for its whole
length by low bushes. Unable to find shade, and these bushes being
still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> some distance
ahead, we lunched in the open sunlight at a spot where the wind,
sweeping over the ridge, brought us all the coolness which we could
desire.</p>

<p>We were now on the great mediæval highway from Qus to Kossair,
by which the Arabian and Indian trade with Egypt was once
conducted. The quarries of Hammamât lie on the main road to the
sea. Nowadays the road starts from Keneh; in ancient times it
started from Koptos, now called Quft, about ten miles south of
Keneh; and in mediæval days it started from Qus, about ten miles
south of Quft again. The roads from these different places join at
the little oasis of Lagêta, which lies some four-and-twenty miles
back from the Nile valley.</p>

<p>Riding into Lagêta in mid-afternoon the scene was one of great
charm. The flat desert stretched around us in a haze of heat. In
the far distance ahead the mountains of Hammamât could be seen,
blue, misty, and indistinct. The little oasis, with its isolated
groups of tamarisks, its four or five tall palms, its few acacias,
and its one little crop of corn, formed a welcome patch of green
amidst the barren wilderness; and the eyes, aching from the glare
around, turned with gratitude towards the soft shadows of the
trees. A large, and probably<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_32">[32]</span> ancient, well of brackish water forms the
nucleus around which the few poor huts cluster; and two or three
<i>shadufs</i>, or water-hoists, are to be seen here and there. A
ruined, many-domed building which may have been a caravanserai, or
perhaps a Coptic monastery, stands picturesquely under a spreading
acacia; and near it we found the fragment of a Greek inscription in
which, like a light emerging momentarily from the darkness of the
past, the name of the Emperor Tiberius Claudius was to be seen. The
few villagers idly watched us as we dismounted and walked through
the settlement, too bathed in the languor of their monotonous life
to bother to do more than greet with mild interest those of our
camelmen whom they knew; and while we sat under the tamarisks to
drink our tea, the only living thing which took any stock of us and
our doings was a small green willow-wren in search of a crumb of
food.</p>

<p>The camp was pitched to the east of the oasis, and at dawn we
continued our way. The temperature was not more than 38° Fahrenheit
when the sun rose, and we were constrained to break into a hard
trot in order to keep warm. Two desert martins circled about us as
we went, now passing under the camels’ necks, and now whirling
overhead; while more than once we put up a few<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_33">[33]</span> cream-coloured coursers, who went off with
a whirr into the space around. After a couple of hours’ riding over
the open, hard-surfaced desert, we topped a low ridge and came into
view of a ruined Roman station, called in ancient times the
Hydreuma, and now known as Kasr el Benât, “the Castle of the
Maidens.” The building stands in a level plain around which the low
hills rise, and to the east the distant Hammamât mountains form a
dark background. From the outside one sees a well-made rectangular
wall, and entering the doorway on the north side one passes into an
enclosure surrounded by a series of small chambers, the roofs of
which have now fallen in. In these little rooms the weary Roman
officers and the caravan masters rested themselves as they passed
to and fro between the quarries and the Nile; and in this
courtyard, when haply the nights were warm, they sang their songs
to the stars and dreamed their dreams of Rome. The building is so
little ruined that one may picture it as it then was without any
difficulty; and such is the kindness of Time that one peoples the
place with great men and good, intent on their work and happy in
their exile, rather than with that riff-raff which so often found
its way to these outlying posts.</p>

<p>Across the plain, opposite the entrance to the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> Hydreuma, there is a large
isolated rock with cliff-like sides, upon which one finds all
manner of inscriptions and rough drawings. Here there are two
Sinaitic inscriptions of rare value and several curious signs in an
unknown script, while Ababdeh marks and Arabic letters are
conspicuous.</p>

<p>We mounted our camels again at about eleven o’clock, and rode
towards the wall of the Medîk es-Salâm hills ahead, passing into
their shadows soon after noonday. We halted for luncheon in the
shade of a group of rocks, and our meal was enlivened by the
presence of two butterflies which seemed out of place in the barren
desert, and yet in harmony with the breezy, light-hearted spirit of
the place. Early in the afternoon we rode on, but an hour had not
passed when some obvious inscriptions on the rocks to the left of
the track, opposite a point where the road bends sharply to the
right, attracted my attention. These proved to date from the Middle
Empire, about <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2000, and no doubt
marked a camp of that date. The names of various officials were
given, and a prayer or two to the gods was to be read. Rounding the
corner, we had no sooner settled ourselves to the camels’ trot than
another group of inscriptions on the rocks to the right of the path
necessitated a further halt. Here there were two very
important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span> graffiti of
the time of Akhnaton; and considerable light is thrown by one of
them upon the fascinating period of the religious revolution of
that king. One sees three cartouches, of which the first is that of
Queen Thiy, the second reads Amonhotep (IV.), and the third seems
to have given the name Akhnaton; but both this cartouche and that
of Thiy are erased. The three cartouches are placed together above
the symbols of sovereignty, and below the rays of the sun’s disk,
thus showing that Akhnaton was but a boy of tender years under his
mother’s guidance when he first came to the throne, and that the
Aton worship had already begun. It would be too long a matter to
explain the significance of this inscription here, but those who
are of an inquiring mind may turn to the article on this subject in
the October number of ‘Blackwood’s Magazine’ for 1907, where I have
described how the recently found mummy of Akhnaton proved to be
that of a very young man.</p>

<p>The shadows were lengthening when we once more mounted and
trotted up the valley, which presently led into more open ground;
but after half an hour’s ride a second Roman station came into
sight, and again the grumbling camels had to kneel. The building is
much ruined, and is not of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_36">[36]</span> great interest to those who have already seen
the Hydreuma and other stations. As we continued the journey the
sun set behind us, and in the growing moonlight the valley looked
ghostly and wonderfully beautiful. The shapes of the rocks became
indistinct, and one was hardly aware when the well known as Bir
Hammamât was at last reached. This well lies in a flat, gravelly
amphitheatre amidst the rugged hills, which press in on all sides.
It is in all about six hours’ ride—<i>i.e.</i>, twenty-eight or
thirty miles—from Lagêta; but our several halts had spread the
journey over twice that length of time. The well is circular and
fairly large, and stones dropped into its pitch-dark depths seemed
a long time in striking the water. A subterranean stairway,
restored in recent years by a mining company, runs down at one side
to the water’s level; and at its doorway in the moonlight we sat
and smoked until the baggage camels came up.</p>

<p>The next morning we rode up a valley which was now tortuous and
narrow. This is the Wady Hammamât of the archæologist, and the Wady
Fowakhîeh of the natives. Dark, threatening hills towered on either
side, as though eager to prison for ever the deeds once enacted at
their feet. One’s voice echoed amongst the rocks, and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> the wind carried the sound down
the valley and round the bend, adding to it its own quiet whispers.
A ride of about half an hour’s length brought us to some ruined
huts where the ancient quarrymen had lived in the days of the
Pharaohs. From this point onwards for perhaps a mile the rocks on
either side are dotted with inscriptions, from which a part of the
history of the valley may be learnt. The place is full of whispers.
As the breeze blows round the rocks and up the silent water-courses
it is as though the voices of men long since forgotten were
drifting uncertainly by. One feels as though the rocks were peopled
with insistent entities, all muttering the tales of long ago.
Behind this great rock there is something laughing quietly to
itself; up this dry waterfall there is a sort of whimpering; and
here in this silent recess one might swear that the word to be
silent had been passed around. It is only the wind and the effect
of the contrast between the exposed and the still places sheltered
by the rocks; but, with such a history as is writ upon its walls,
one might believe the valley to be crowded with the ghosts of those
who have suffered or triumphed in it.</p>

<p>Wady Fowakhîeh extends from the Bir Hammamât to the well known
as Bir Fowakhîeh, which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_38">[38]</span> lies in the open circus at the east end of
the valley. Although the tuff quarried here is of a blue or
olive-green colour, the surface of the rocks, except where they are
broken, is a sort of chocolate-brown. One thus obtains an
extraordinary combination of browns and blues, which with the flush
of the sunset and the dim purple of the distant hill-tops forms a
harmony as beautiful as any the world knows. The flat, gravel bed
of the valley is from fifty to a hundred yards wide, and along this
level surface run numerous camel-tracks, more or less parallel with
one another. Besides the inscriptions there are other traces of
ancient work: an unfinished shrine, and a sarcophagus, abandoned
owing to its having cracked, are to be seen where the workmen of
some five-and-twenty centuries ago left them; and here and there a
group of ruined huts is to be observed.</p>

<p>Amidst these relics of the old world our tents were pitched,
having been removed from Bir Hammamât as soon as breakfast had been
finished; and with camera, note-book, and sketching apparatus, the
four of us dispersed in different directions, my own objective, of
course, being the inscriptions. The history of Wady Fowakhîeh
begins when the history of Egypt begins, and one<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> must look back into the dim
uncertainties of the archaic period for the first evidences of the
working of the quarries in this valley. Many beautifully made bowls
and other objects of this tuff are found in the graves of Dynasty
I., fifty-five centuries ago; and my friends and I, scrambling over
the rocks, were fortunate enough to find in a little wady leading
northwards from the main valley a large rock-drawing and
inscription of this date. A “vase-maker” here offers a prayer to
the sacred barque of the hawk-god Horus, which is drawn so clearly
that one may see the hawk standing upon its shrine in the boat, an
upright spear set before the door; and one may observe the bull’s
head, so often found in primitive countries, affixed to the prow;
while the barque itself is shown to be standing upon a sledge in
order that it might be dragged over the ground.</p>

<p>In Dynasties II. to IV. the objects in the museums show that the
quarries were extensively worked, and in Dynasty V. one has the
testimony of local inscriptions as well. An official under King
Asesa, <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2675, has left his name on the
rocks on the south of the valley; and the name of another who lived
in the reign of Unas, <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2650, is to be
seen there. Of the reign of Pepy I., <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
2600, of Dynasty VI., one has more definite<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_40">[40]</span> information. Scanning the rocks one reads
of chief architects, master builders, assistant artisans, scribes,
treasurers, ship-captains, and their families stationed at the
quarries to procure stone for the ornamentation of the pyramid
buildings of the king, which are still to be seen at Sakkâra, near
Cairo; and these inscriptions mention a certain Thethi, who was the
“master pyramid-builder of the king,” and therefore was probably in
charge of the expedition.</p>

<p>In the reign of Aty, <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2400, a
ship’s captain named Apa came to procure stone for his master’s
pyramid; and with him were 200 soldiers and 200 workmen. King
Imhotep, <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2400, sent his son Zaty with
1000 labourers, 100 quarrymen, and 1200 soldiers, to obtain stone;
and he supplied 200 donkeys and 50 oxen daily for its transport.
But the first really interesting inscription on the rocks of the
valley dates from Dynasty XI., <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2050.
Here an all too brief story is told by a great official named Henu,
recording an expedition made by him to the distant land of Pount in
the eighth year of the reign of Menthuhotep III. The king had
ordered Henu to despatch a ship to Pount in order to bring fresh
myrrh from that land of spices, and he had therefore collected an
army of 3000 men. He set out from Koptos,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_41">[41]</span> travelled over the open desert to the little
oasis of Lagêta, and so struck the road which we had followed. He
seems to have had much consideration for his men, for he says, “I
made the road a river, and the desert a stretch of field. I gave a
leather bottle, a carrying pole, two jars of water, and twenty
loaves of bread to each one of the men every day.” When one
considers that this means 60,000 loaves of bread per day, one’s
respect for the organising powers of the ancient Egyptians must be
considerable. At Wady Fowakhîeh he seems to have organised some
quarry works for the king, and presently he pushed on towards the
Red Sea, digging wells as he went. The expedition, which will be
recorded later, is then described; and Henu states that, on his
return to Wady Fowakhîeh, he organised the transport of some five
blocks of stone which were to be used for making statues.</p>

<p class="left sc">Pl. vi.</p>
</div>

<p>In the second year of the reign of Menthuhotep IV., <span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span> 2000,—so runs another long rock inscription,—the
Vizier Amonemhat was sent to the quarries with an expedition of
10,000 men, consisting of miners, artificers, quarrymen, artists,
draughtsmen, stone-cutters, gold-workers, and officials. His orders
were to procure “an august block of the pure costly stone which is
in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> mountain, for
a sarcophagus, an eternal memorial, and for monuments in the
temples.” The presence of gold-workers indicates that the gold
mines near Bir Fowakhîeh were also opened. Ancient workings are
still to be seen near this well, and in recent times an attempt was
made to reopen them, which, however, was not very successful. One
must imagine this expedition as camping at that well—Bir
Hammamât—where we had camped on the previous night, and as passing
up the valley each day to and from the quarries. This was a tedious
walk, and a nearer water-supply must have been much needed. One day
there was a heavy fall of rain, which must have lasted several
hours, for when it had ceased the sandy plain at the head of the
valley was found to be a veritable lake of water. Rain is not at
all a common occurrence in Upper Egypt. Even now the peasants are
peculiarly alarmed at a heavy downpour; and in those far-off days
the quarrymen were ready enough to see in the phenomenon a direct
act of the great god Min, the patron of the desert. “Rain was
made,” says the inscription, “and the form of this god appeared in
it; his glory was shown to men. The highland was made a lake, the
water extending to the margin of the rocks.” The presence of the
water seems to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
dislodged an accumulation of sand which had formed over an ancient
and disused well; and when the lake subsided the astonished
labourers discovered its mouth, ten cubits in length on its every
side. “Soldiers of old and kings who had lived aforetime went out
and returned by its side; yet no eye had seen it.” It was
“undefiled, and had been kept pure and clean from the gazelle, and
concealed from the Bedwin.” If this well is, as I suppose, the Bir
Fowakhîeh, it must have been a great boon to the workmen, for it is
but a few minutes’ walk from the quarries, and must have saved them
that weary tramp down to the Bir Hammamât at the end of their hard
day’s work.</p>

<p>When the great stone for the lid of the sarcophagus had been
prised out of the hillside, and had been toppled into the valley,
another wonder occurred. Down the track there came running “a
gazelle great with young, going towards the people before her,
while her eyes looked backward, though she did not turn back.” The
quarrymen must have ceased their work to watch her as she ran along
the hard valley, looking back with startled eyes as the shouts of
the men assailed her. At last “she arrived at this block intended
for the lid of the sarcophagus, it being still in its<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> place; and upon it she dropped
her young, while the whole army of the king watched her.” One can
hear the quarrymen, as they clattered into the valley, shouting, “A
miracle, a miracle!” and surrounded the incapacitated creature. The
end of the tale is told briefly. “Then they cut her throat upon the
block, and brought fire. The block descended to the Nile in
safety.”</p>

<p>Another inscription states that this sarcophagus lid was dragged
down to the river by an army of 3000 sailors from the Delta, and
that sacrifices of cattle, goats, and incense were constantly made
in order to lighten the labour. It must have been an enormous block
to drag along; for even after it was dressed into the required
shape and size by the masons in Egypt, it was some 14 feet in
length, 7 feet in width, and 3½ feet in thickness. Two other blocks
brought down from these quarries at about the same date are said to
have been 17 feet in length, while a third was about 20 feet
long.</p>

<p>In the reign of Amonemhat I. of Dynasty XII., <span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span> 2000, an officer named Antef was sent to the
quarries to procure a special kind of stone, so rare that “there
was no hunter who knew the marvel of it, and none that sought it
had found it.” “I spent eight days,” says Antef, “searching the
hills<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> for it, but I
knew not the place wherein it might be. I prostrated myself before
Min, before Mut, before the goddess great in magic, and before all
the gods of the highlands, burning incense to them upon the fire.”
At last, after almost giving up the search in despair, he found the
required block one morning just as the sun had topped the dark
hills of the valley, and while his men were just scattering in all
directions to renew the search. Although so many centuries have
passed since Antef found his stone, one feels, when one reads this
inscription upon the rocks, that it was but yesterday; and one may
picture the sunlit scene when, as he says, “the company were in
festivity and the entire army was praising, rejoicing, and doing
obeisance.”</p>

<p>Under other kings of this dynasty one reads, as one walks up the
valley, of works being carried on. One man quarried and carried
down to the river ten blocks which were later converted into seated
statues 8½ feet high. Another official speaks of his army of 2000
men which he had with him in this now desolate place; and a third
has left an inscription reading, “I came to these highlands with my
army in safety, by the power of Min, the Lord of the
Highlands.”</p>

<p>So the work continued from generation to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_46">[46]</span> generation, and the quarrymen, as they sat
at noon to rest themselves in the shade, could read around them the
names of dead kings and forgotten officials carved upon the rocks,
and could place their own names in the illustrious company. The
troubled years of the Hyksos rule checked the quarrying somewhat;
but in Dynasty XVIII. the labours were renewed, though
unfortunately no long inscriptions have been left to illuminate the
darkness of the history of the valley. An inscription of the time
of Akhnaton is to be seen high up on the rocks, but other figures
have been cut over it by Sety I.</p>

<p>Various kings of Dynasties XIX. and XX. are mentioned on the
rocks; but the only important inscription dates from the second
year of the reign of Rameses IV., <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1165. It seems that this king, with a degree of energy unusual in a
Pharaoh of this debased period, made a personal visit to the
quarries. “He led the way to the place he desired; he went around
the august mountain; he cut an inscription upon this mountain
engraved with the great name of the king.” This inscription is to
be seen on the rocks of the valley, almost as fresh as when the
scribes had written it. On his return to Egypt he organised an
expedition for the purpose of quarrying the stone he had selected.
A complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> list of
the <i>personnel</i> of the expedition is recorded, and, as it
gives one an idea of the usual composition of a force of this kind,
I may be permitted to give it in some detail.</p>

<p>The head of the expedition was none other than the High Priest
of Amon, and his immediate staff consisted of the king’s butlers,
the deputy of the army and his secretary, the overseer of the
treasury, two directors of the quarry service, the court
charioteer, and the clerk of the army lists. Twenty clerks of the
army, or of the War Office as we would say, and twenty inspectors
of the court stables were attached to this group. Under a military
commandant there were 20 infantry officers and 5000 men, 50
charioteers, 200 sailors, and a mixed body of 50 priests, scribes,
overseers, and veterinary inspectors. Under a chief artificer and
three master quarrymen there were 130 stone-cutters and quarrymen;
while the main work was done by 2000 crown slaves and 800 foreign
captives. Two draughtsmen and four sculptors were employed for
engraving the inscriptions, &amp;c. A civil magistrate with 50
police kept order amongst this large force, which altogether
totalled 8362 men, not including, as the inscription grimly states,
the 900 souls who perished from fatigue, hunger, disease, or
exposure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
</p>

<p>The supplies for this large expedition were transported in ten
carts each drawn by six yoke of oxen; and there were many porters
laden with bread, meat, and various kinds of cakes. The inscription
then tells us of the sacrifices which were continuously made to the
gods of the desert. “There were brought from Thebes the oblations
for the satisfaction of the gods of heaven and earth. Bulls were
slaughtered, calves were smitten, incense streamed to heaven,
<i>shedeh</i> and wine was like a flood, beer flowed in this place.
The voice of the ritual-priest presented these pure offerings to
all the gods of the mountains so that their hearts were glad.”</p>

<p>In this remote desert how easy it is to dream oneself back in
the elder days! The valley, pressed close on either side by the
rocks around which the whispers for ever wander, echoes once again
with the ring of the chisels; and in the wind that almost
ceaselessly rushes over the ancient tracks, one can see the
fluttering garments of the quarrymen as they pass to and from their
work. As we sat at the door of our tents in the cool of the
afternoon, the present day seemed now as remote as the past had
seemed before; and, when that great moment of sunset was
approached, one almost felt it fitting to burn a pan of incense
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> the old gods of
heaven and earth, as the officers of Rameses IV. had done.</p>

<p>The names of later kings, Shabaka, Taharka, Psametik, Nekau,
Aahmes II., and others, look down at one from the rocks; and
sometimes the date is precisely given, and the names of the
officials are mentioned. During the Persian period the green tuff
was in considerable demand for the making of those lifelike
portrait statuettes so many of which are to be seen in the various
museums; and the coarser tuff, which is practically breccia, was
much used for shrines and sarcophagi. It is curious to see in this
distant valley the names of the Persian kings, Cambyses, Darius I.,
Xerxes I., and Artaxerxes I., written in Egyptian hieroglyphs in
the rock inscriptions, together with the year of their reigns in
which the quarrying was undertaken. Nectanebo I. and II.,
<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 370 and <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
350, have left their names in the valley; and dating from this and
the subsequent periods there are various Egyptian and Greek
inscriptions.</p>

<p>In the reign of Ptolemy III., <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 240,
a little temple was built near the Bir Fowakhîeh at the east end of
the valley of the quarries. Wandering over this amphitheatre amidst
the hills we came upon the remains of the little building, which
had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> been constructed
of rough stones augmented by well-made basalt columns. It was
dedicated to the god Min, the patron of the Eastern Desert; but as
it was only about 12 feet by 22 in area the priests of the god
could not have commanded the devotion of more than a few of the
quarrymen. Near the temple there are three or four groups of ruined
huts, nestling on the hillsides amongst the rocks; and here the
quarrymen of the Ptolemaic and Græco-Roman ages dwelt, as the
broken pottery indicates. There are many traces of ancient gold
workings near by, and a ruined house of modern construction stands
as a sad memorial of the unsuccessful attempt to reopen them. In
the inscriptions of Dynasties XVIII.-XX. one reads of “the gold of
Koptos,” which must be the gold brought into Koptos from this
neighbourhood; and at this later period the mines appear to have
been worked. A very fine pink granite began to be quarried just to
the east of this well in Roman days, and one may still see many
blocks cut from the hillside which have lain there these two
thousand years awaiting transport.</p>

<p>In Wady Fowakhîeh itself there are many blocks of tuff,
addressed to the Cæsars, but never dispatched to them; nor is there
anything in this time-forsaken valley which so brings the
past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> before one as do
these blocks awaiting removal to vanished cities. There are many
Greek inscriptions to be seen, the majority being grouped together
in a recess amidst the rocks on the south side of the valley. Here
one reads of persons who worked for Tiberius, Nero, Domitian, and
other emperors; and there are their drawings of men, animals, and
boats before one, as fresh as when an hour at noon was whiled away
in their making. From these the last days of the quarrying dates a
causeway which passes up the hillside on the south of the valley,
and which was intended to ease the descent of blocks quarried
higher up. The Romans have also left watch-towers on the hill-tops,
which indicate that peace did not always reign in the desert.</p>

<p>The night which closed in on us all too soon brought with it the
silence of the very grave. The wind fell, and the whisperings
almost ceased. The young moon which lit the valley seemed to turn
all things to stone under its gaze; and not a sound fell from the
camelmen or from the camels. The evening meal having been eaten and
the pipes smoked, we quietly slipped into our beds; and when the
moon had set behind the hills and absolute darkness had fallen upon
the valley, one might have believed oneself as dead and as
deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> in the
underworld as the kings whose names were inscribed upon the black
rocks around.</p>

<p>On the following morning we continued our journey eastwards
towards the Red Sea, along the old trade route. This expedition
forms a subject which will be treated by itself in the next
chapter, and therefore one may here pass over the week occupied by
the journey, and may resume the thread of the present narrative at
the date when we set out from Wady Fowakhîeh on our homeward way.
The day was already hot as we trotted down the valley and past the
Bir Hammamât, where, by the way, we put up another family of
cream-coloured coursers. A couple of hours’ trotting brought us to
a cluster of sandstone rocks on the north of the now open and wide
road, these having been passed in the dusk on the outward journey.
Here I found one or two inscriptions in unknown letters, a few
Egyptian graffiti, and a little Græco-Roman shrine dedicated to the
great god Min. On these rocks we ate our luncheon, and rested in
the shade; and in the early afternoon we mounted once more, passing
the second Roman station half an hour later. A ride of two and a
half hours brought us to the Hydreuma about sunset, and here we
halted to smoke a pipe and stretch our legs. Then in the moonlight
we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> rode on once more
over the open desert, which stretched in hazy uncertainty as far as
the eye could see. The oasis of Lagêta was reached at about seven
o’clock, and, the night having turned cold, we were glad to find
the camp fires already brightly burning and the kettle merrily
boiling.</p>

<p>We were on the road again soon after sunrise, and, riding
towards Koptos, about ten or twelve miles from Lagêta we passed
another Roman enclosure now almost entirely destroyed. Our route
now lay to the north of the hills of el Gorn, the south side of
which we had seen on our outward journey; and after three and a
half hours’ riding we came into sight of the distant Nile valley.
The thin line of green trees seemed in the mirage to be swimming in
water, as though the period of the inundation were upon us again.
At the point where this view is first obtained there are some low
hills on the south side of the tracks, and in one of these there is
a small red-ochre quarry. The sandstone is veined with ochre, and
the quarry had been opened for the purpose of obtaining this
material for the making of red paint; but whether the few red
markings on the rocks are ancient or mediæval one cannot say. Here
we ate an early luncheon, and about noon we rode on over the
sun-bathed plain down to the cultivation.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_54">[54]</span> Leaving the desert our road passed between
the fields towards the Nile; and by two o’clock we reached the
picturesque village of Quft, which marks the site of the ancient
Koptos. We spent the afternoon in wandering over the ruins of the
once famous caravanserai, and in the evening we took the train back
to Luxor.</p>

<p>Such are the quarries of Hammamât, and such is the road to them.
It is a simple journey, and one able to be undertaken by any active
person who will take the trouble to order a few camels from Keneh.
There will come a time when one will travel to the quarries by
automobile, for even the present road is hard-surfaced enough to
permit of that form of locomotion, and with a little doctoring it
will be not far from perfection. A place such as this wonderful
valley, with its whispers and its echoes, seems to beckon to the
curious to come, if only to be lost for awhile in the soothing
solitudes and moved by the majestic beauty of the hills. To those
interested in the olden days the rocks hold out an invitation which
one is surprised to find so seldom responded to; but let any one
feel for an hour the fine freedom of the desert, and see for an
hour the fantasy of the hills, and that invitation will not again
be so lightly set aside.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_55">[55]</span> On camel or automobile he will make his way
over the ancient tracks to the dark valley of the quarries; and
there he will remain entranced, just as we, until the business of
life calls him back to the habitations of present-day men.</p>

<h2><a id="c3"></a>III.<br>
THE RED SEA HIGHROAD.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">In</span> the reach of the Nile
between Quft and Keneh, a few miles below Luxor, the river makes
its nearest approach to the Red Sea, not more than 110 miles of
desert separating the two waters at this point. From Quft, the
ancient Koptos, to Kossair, the little seaport town, there runs the
great highroad of ancient days, along which the Egyptians travelled
who were engaged in the Eastern trade. It happened by chance that
this route led through the Wady Fowakhîeh in which the famous
quarries were situated; and in the last chapter I have recorded an
expedition made to that place in 1907. From the quarries I set out
with my three friends for the sea; and, as the route from the Nile
to Wady Fowakhîeh has already been described, it now remains to
record its continuation eastwards and our journeying upon it.</p>

<p>The history of this highroad is of considerable interest, for it
may be said to be the most ancient<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_57">[57]</span> of the routes of which the past has left us
any record; and its hard surface has been beaten down by the fall
of feet almost continuously from the dawn of human things to the
present day. It has been thought by some that a large element of
the prehistoric inhabitants of the Nile valley came into Egypt by
this road. Excavations at Quft (Koptos) have shown the city to date
from Dynasty I., if not earlier; and the great archaic statues of
Min, the god of the desert, one of which is to be seen at the
Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, were here found. The ancient Egyptians
always believed that the home of their ancestors was in the land of
Pount, the region around Suakin; and since so many archaic remains
have been found at Koptos, the terminus of a route which in
historical times was sometimes used by persons travelling to Pount,
it seems not unlikely that there was a certain infiltration of
Pountites into Egypt by way of Kossair and Quft. These people
travelling in ships along the coast, Arabians sailing from the
eastern shores of the Red Sea, or Bedwin journeying by land from
Sinai and Suez, may have passed over this road to trade with the
inhabitants of Upper Egypt; but, on the other hand, there is no
evidence to show that any extensive immigration or invasion took
place. The coast of the Red Sea<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_58">[58]</span> is utterly barren, and the wells are few in
number; and one could more readily imagine the prehistoric
inhabitants of Egypt pushing eastwards on hunting expeditions until
they encountered the sea, and thus opening up the route, than one
could picture these Eastern peoples penetrating from an untenable
base to a hostile country at the dawn of known days.</p>

<p>Upon the archaic statues of the god Min at Koptos there are many
rude drawings scratched on the stone surface. These represent
<i>pteroceras</i> shells, the saws of sawfish, a stag’s head, the
forepart of an elephant, a hyæna, a young bull, an ostrich, and a
flying bird. It is evident that these drawings would not have been
scratched upon the statue of the tribal god without some sort of
meaning being attached to them, and it seems probable that one may
see in them the articles of commerce which the people of Koptos
imported from the Red Sea: shells, horn, ivory, feathers, and
skins.</p>

<p>The earliest written record of a journey to Kossair dates from
Dynasty XI., <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2020, when an official
named Henu travelled from Koptos to Kossair, and thence to Pount.
“The king sent me,” says Henu, “to dispatch a ship to Pount to
bring for him the fresh myrrh from the chieftains<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> of the desert which had been
offered to him by reason of the fear of him in those countries.
Then I went forth from Koptos upon the road as his Majesty
commanded me. Troops cleared the way before me, overthrowing those
hostile to the king; and the hunters and the children of the desert
were posted as the protection of my limbs. . . . Then I reached the
Red Sea, and I built this ship, and I dispatched it with
everything, after I had made for it a great oblation of cattle,
bulls, and ibexes.” Henu, no doubt, carried the material for
building the vessel across the desert, and settled down on the
coast to build it, his supplies being sent to him from Koptos as
often as necessary. He tells us in another part of the inscription
that he dug several wells in the desert; and one can imagine his
little company living quite happily beside one of these wells near
the seashore while the vessel was hammered together on the beach
below. After the lapse of four thousands of years one may still
picture these scenes: the launching of the ship into the blue
waters, when the savour of burnt-offerings streamed up to heaven,
and the shouts of the workmen rang across the sandy beach; the
tedious journey along the barren coast, always the yellow hills
upon one’s right and always the boundless sea upon one’s left; the
landing on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> the
strange shores of Pount, where the precious myrrh-trees abundantly
grew and there was talk of gold as of a thing of little worth;
where sleek, bearded men and amazingly fat women sat at the doors
of bee-hive huts raised from the ground upon piles; and where,
walking abroad, one might meet with giraffes and other surprising
creatures whose existence would not be credited by one’s friends at
home. An Englishman feels that it would almost have been worth the
four thousand years of subsequent oblivion to have seen what these
adventurers saw!</p>

<p>During the next twenty centuries the road seems to have been in
almost continual use, but there are no interesting inscriptions
recording expeditions made along it, though one may be sure that
many of the trading expeditions passed over this route to the land
of Pount. The town of Kossair seems to have been called Thaau at
this period, but in Græco-Roman days this name has developed into
Tuau or Duau, a word written in hieroglyphs simply with three
stars. The trade with Arabia and India which flourished during the
rule of the Ptolemies brought the road into very general use, and
Kossair became as important a trading town as any in Egypt.
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> harbour, however,
was so poor that a new port and town was constructed some five
miles to the north, where a natural bay was easily able to be
improved into a very fair harbour. This new town was named
Philoteras, in honour of the sister of Ptolemy Philadelphos
(<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 285), while the older port was now
known as Aennum by foreigners, though to the Egyptians both towns
were called Duau. I was fortunate enough to find some blocks of a
Ptolemaic temple at the older Kossair, and on one of them was the
name Duau, followed by the hieroglyph representing a town written
twice to indicate the existence of the two ports. Not infrequently
one finds at Koptos and elsewhere short inscriptions of this period
relating to journeys made along this route to Kossair, and thence
over the high seas. One example may here be quoted: “To the most
high goddess Isis, for a fair voyage for the ship <i>Serapis</i>,
Hermæus dedicates this.”</p>

<p>I must be permitted to give in full a very interesting tariff of

<p>In the above tariff it will be seen that the persons or articles
on which taxes were levied were such as one might expect to have
passed between the Nile and the sea; and only those items
concerning women seem to call for explanation.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_63">[63]</span> The very large tax imposed upon
prostitutes must indicate that Indian or Arabian females coming
into Egypt along this route, and liable to bring with them the
evils of the East, could only be admitted when they were of the
richest and, consequently, best and highest class. Such women were
always taxed in the Roman Empire, and in this regard a rather
humorous story is told in Philostratus’ Life of Apollonius of
Tyana. That holy man was accosted by a tax-collector when about to
cross the Euphrates, and was asked his wares. He replied with the
somewhat <i>banal</i> remark that he had with him <i>Sōphrosúnē kai
Dikaiosúnē kai ’Andreia</i>—“Temperance, Righteousness, and
Courage.” The official at once assessed these as <i>Doúlas</i>,
“Female slaves,” and would have taxed them as prostitutes, had not
the prophet hastily corrected him by saying that they were not
<i>Doúlas</i> but <i>Despoínas</i>, “Ladies of the House”! The
“wives of soldiers” mentioned in the tariff shows that Mommsen was
right in stating that the rule of the emperors was laxer in Egypt
than elsewhere, for before the time of Severus it was not possible
for legionaries to contract legal marriages while on active
service; but in Egypt the marriages were so far recognised that the
wives could be taxed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
as such, and the children could be enrolled as legionaries.</p>

<p>During mediæval times this Red Sea highroad was much used by
traders, but its river terminus was now removed from Koptos to Kus,
a town a few miles farther up-stream, which soon became second only
to Cairo in size and wealth. A pottery figure of Buddha, some
mediæval Chinese vases, and a few Arabian antiquities, found in
Upper Egypt, are records of the use of this route at that time. In
later days the terminus again shifted to Keneh, a few miles to the
north of Koptos, and to that town there still come Arabian traders
from across the Red Sea, and pilgrims sometimes use it as the base
of the journey to Mecca.</p>

<p>From Wady Fowakhîeh our party set out along this highroad at
about 7 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span> on a bracing morning in
November. From Bir Fowakhîeh the road branched off to the right
along a fine valley, shut in by hills fantastic in shape and
colour. Clustering on either side of the path for some distance
there were groups of huts, and in the hillsides there were traces
of gold mines long since abandoned. The road beneath one was hard,
flat, and blue-grey in colour, as though some mighty torrent had
brought down masses of gravel and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_65">[65]</span> had laid it level over the bottom of the
valley. Gradually it sloped upwards, and as the hills drew in on
either side one felt that the highest point of the whole road was
soon to be reached. We were already half-way between the Nile and
the sea, and so far there had been a continuous slope upwards, so
gradual as to be almost imperceptible. The valley now twisted and
turned narrowly between the dark hills, and the gravel bed became
humped and banked up where the early waters had raced down some
narrow gauge and had churned themselves through a natural basin
into the wide bed beyond. The cold wind beat in our faces as we
trotted up the narrowing valley, and the sun had not yet gained
much power when, after a ride of two hours, we reached the rugged
pass which forms the apex of the route.</p>

<p>The scenery here is superb. The pathway, such as it is, threads
its way through a cluster of great grey boulders tumbled into the
few yards’ width between the rocks of the hillside, so that on foot
one may jump from stone to stone up the whole length of the pass,
and on camelback one has to twist and turn, rise and descend, until
the saddle-straps come near to bursting. Amidst the rocks there is
a well, known as Bir es Sid, which may have been opened in ancient
times, perhaps by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
redoubtable Henu. A few natives were encamped near by, and not far
away their goats were to be seen in the charge of a small girl,
whose dark dress fluttering in the wind caught one’s eye amidst the
pale grey of rocks and the cold blue of the shadows.</p>

<p>Riding on for another two hours we reached an open ridge from
which an extraordinary prospect of rolling hills and innumerable
humps was obtained. On the left of the pathway there was a hill at
the top of which stood a ruined Roman watch-tower, one of a chain
of such posts which crowned the higher peaks all along the route.
Up this hill we scrambled on foot, and climbed the tower at the
summit, burning a pipeful of tobacco to the gods of Contentment
thereon. The array of hills around us, as closely packed and yet as
individual as the heads of a vast crowd of people, were of a
wonderful hue in the morning light. Those to the north were a dead
grey, those to the east were pink and mauve, and those to the south
every shade of rich brown, while the shadows throughout were of the
deepest blue. The wind tore past us as we sat contemplating the
fair world at our feet, and two black ravens sailed by on it to
take stock of us. Far below the path wound its way through the
humps; and in the distance the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_67">[67]</span> peaks and spires of the darker rocks into
which it penetrated bounded the scene, and hid the sea from
view.</p>

<p>Mounting the camels once more we defiled down the steep path,
and for a time were lost amidst the hills. We lunched an hour later
in more open country; and riding on afterwards for somewhat over
two hours we reached the Roman station of Abu Zerah, which lies in
the plain at the foot of a range of fine purple hills. As is usual
in these buildings, the station consists of a rectangular
enclosure, the wall being still some twelve feet in height in
parts. The door-posts of the main entrance are made of sandstone,
and upon one of them is the almost obliterated Latin inscription:
SER . . . INV. . . . There are several rooms inside the enclosure,
built against the wall, a space being left open in the middle. Just
to the north there are a few graves, around which some broken
pottery of Roman date lies scattered.</p>

<p>A ride of less than an hour brought us to another Roman station
known as Hosh el Homra, “the Red Enclosure,” where we only halted
for a moment or so in order to ascertain that there was no unique
feature in this building. In the afternoon light the scene was of
great beauty. Range<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
upon range of hills surrounded us, which assumed a thousand varying
colours: pink, rose, purple, blue, and olive-green in the
foreground. Spires of rock shot up to a soft sky in which floated
the already visible moon, and overhead seven black ravens soared
past upon the wind. Soon the sun went down, and, resting in the lee
of a group of dark rocks, we watched the pageant of colours go by
and waited for the baggage camels to come up.</p>

<p>The journey was resumed at an early hour next morning, and after
a trot of about three-quarters of an hour we reached the well and
Roman station of Hagi Suliman. The ancient well, lying within the
enclosing wall, has been restored in modern times, and upon a
tablet let into the wall is rudely written: “Briggs, Hancock, and
Wood, 1832.” At this point the road is joined by another from the
north-west, along which we made our return journey to Bir Fowakhîeh
by way of Wady el Esh and Wady Adolla. From Bir Hagi Suliman to Bir
Fowakhîeh by this route is a trot of about six hours. The morning
was bitterly cold, and the wind swinging up the valley chilled one
to the bone. The tracks led now this way and now that, around sharp
corners where the wind buffeted one suddenly, across patches of
sunlight where there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
was some hope of warmth, and then again up shaded valleys where one
might see an occasional wagtail or sand-martin puffing its feathers
out against the cold airs. A trot of two and a half hours brought
us to yet another Roman ruin, called El Litêmah. Here there is as
usual an enclosing wall surrounding an area in which several
chambers are built and a well is dug. The door-posts of the
entrance are made of sandstone, and some Cufic inscriptions are
written upon one of these by travellers in the middle ages. As we
entered the building a number of sand-grouse rose from the midst of
the ruins and went off to the north, their swift flight being
visible for some time against a background of pale limestone hills,
which told of our approach to the sea. Near here we passed a party
of Arabian traders, some riding camels and others walking. A more
evil-looking set of men I have seldom seen, and as they eyed us and
whispered together one felt that some mischief was afoot. It was
therefore not surprising to learn when we returned to the Nile that
a caravan had been attacked with considerable bloodshed at about
that place and time, by Arabians answering to this description.</p>

<p>An hour and quarter later we emerged from the hills into an open
plain in which the well known<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_70">[70]</span> as Bir el Ingliz is situated. This well was
dug by English troops at the beginning of the nineteenth century,
during operations against Napoleon’s generals, of which further
mention will be made. A few Ababdeh natives were here encamped, and
hastened to draw water for our thirsty camels, begging a cigarette
as a reward for the labour. In the shade of some rocks to the
south-east we partook of our luncheon. The seat which I selected
for myself proved to be that chosen by a prehistoric hunter some
sixty centuries ago, for upon the face of the rock beside it there
is a rude archaic drawing of a man holding a bow. Two French
soldiers of 1799 have here written their names—Forcard and
Materon—which remain as memorials of a page of history little
remembered at the present time.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we trotted over open desert and through shady
valleys for about the space of an hour, at the end of which we
reached the spring known as Bir Ambagi, situated in a fine wady,
with grey-green cliffs on either hand and pink limestone hills
ahead. In this fair setting there grew the greenest reeds and
rushes amidst pools of the bluest water. A few Ababdeh goats grazed
across the valley, bleating merrily as they went; and not a few
birds added their notes to the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_71">[71]</span> happy fluting of the wind, which, blowing
from over-seas, seemed to set the rushes nodding to “songs of Araby
and tales of old Cashmere.” Leaving this valley we travelled down a
rather dull wash-out sloping towards the sea, which at length
opened sufficiently to show us a glimpse of the blue water. There
is always something which penetrates to the heart in one’s first
view of the sea after an interval of months; and now, the eyes
having accustomed themselves to the barren desert, the old wonder
came upon one with new weapons, and attacked the senses with new
vigour. One might have shouted for the sheer pleasure of it; and
when, presently, a group of green palms passed into view lit by the
afternoon sun, and stood between the sand and the sea, one felt to
the full the power of the assault.</p>

<p>As the hills fell back on either side we passed on to the wide,
flat beach and headed our camels towards the blue sea, dismounting
at last a hundred yards from the rippling water. Except for the
slow pulse of the waves there was an unbroken silence over the
world. Southwards the sand stretched to the foot of the hills,
beyond which rose the dreamy peaks of the Tourquoise Mountains;
northwards the little town of Kossair lay basking in the sunlight;
to the west the dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
hills through which we had passed stood waiting breathlessly to
surround the setting sun; and to the east the wonderful sea seemed
quietly to be sleeping and sighing in its sleep. Had one stumbled
against the slumbering forms of the lotos-eaters themselves one
would hardly have felt surprise; for here one might suppose that
one was in a land “where it was always afternoon,” a land “where
all things always seemed the same.” In the little bay, or high and
dry upon the sand, lay vessels of a bygone age—two-masted hulks
with high ponderous sterns. Beside them one could just discern two
men fast asleep; and had one awakened them there seemed hardly a
doubt that they would have been found to be as mildeyed and
melancholy as the men of Tennyson’s poem.</p>

<p>Presently, as we sat listening to the sea, the sun set, and from
the minaret of a mosque in the town a boy called to the sleepy
Faithful their daily summons to prayer. His voice drifting to us on
the quiet air was the first human sound which had risen from the
little town; but hardly had it died away before the distant sound
of voices, and the grunts of camels, warned us of the arrival of
our baggage. A few figures sauntered idly out of the town to watch
us, as the tents were pitched<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_73">[73]</span> on the beach; and thus the dream was broken,
and we awoke, as it were, to the knowledge that once more a human
habitation had been reached and officials had to be
interviewed.</p>

<p>A note to the Maltese <i>Mudir</i> or governor of the town
brought that gentleman speedily to our tents, obviously pleased
almost to tears to have the opportunity of relieving for an hour
the utter boredom of his existence. The Mudir is an enforced
lotos-eater. Corpulent of figure, and suffering the discomforts of
a wall-eye; having practically no duties to perform other than
those of the brief official routine; and having no European to talk
to except his wife, his little daughter, and an Austrian mechanic,
there is nothing left for him to do but to dream of the time when a
benevolent government shall transfer him to a less isolated post.
The four of us will not soon forget the ample figure of our guest,
clad in white duck, as he sat upon the edge of our one real chair
in the candle-light, and told us in disused English how little
there is to tell regarding a man’s life in this sleepy town. There
was never a more desolate smile than that which wreathed his face
as he spoke of the <i>ennui</i> of life, nor a braver twinkle than
that which glinted in his single eye as the humour of his
misfortunes touched him; and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_74">[74]</span> though we should meet again in many a merrier
situation—for officials are not left over long at Kossair—none of
us will cease to picture this uncomplaining servant of the
government as, with unsmoked cigarette and untasted
whisky-and-soda, he told us that evening the meaning of four years
of exile.</p>

<p>Kossair, when he first entered upon his duties, was a town of
1500 inhabitants; but these persons were so miserably poor, and
found so little to do, that at their own request the government
transported about a thousand of them to Suez and the neighbourhood,
where the lotos does not grow and a man has to keep awake. Now
there are but 500 souls in the town, 300 of whom are women and
children. These people wed very young, and there is much family
intermarriage; but, though they are a poor lot to look at, there is
little mental degeneracy which can be traced to this cause. The
Mudir, who is also in charge of the coastguards, is responsible for
law and order in Kossair; there is a Syrian doctor in charge of the
government dispensary; the above-mentioned Austrian mechanic looks
after the engine for distilling the salt water; a coastguard
officer and three men patrol the coast; four or five sailors are
attached to the port; and a native schoolmaster teaches
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> children to read
and write: this constitutes the official element in the town. The
inhabitants are all either of Arab or Ababdeh stock, Egyptians
being entirely wanting. They live mainly on fish and a little
imported bread; but before the population was reduced some of the
poorer families were actually eating chopped straw and other food
fit only for animals.</p>

</div>

<p>There is very little to be done here, and most of the
inhabitants sleep for two-thirds of the day. A fast-diminishing
trade necessitates the occasional building or mending of a boat.
This trade is done with camels and goats, which are brought across
from Arabia and are led over the desert to the Nile, where they are
sold at Keneh or elsewhere, the money being partly expended on
grain, which is then carried back to Arabia. Pilgrims on the way to
and from Mecca use these vessels occasionally, but the mariners of
Kossair cannot be bothered to extend the tariff.</p>

<p>Except for one small group of palms there is absolutely no
vegetation whatsoever in the neighbourhood, and even an attempt to
grow a few bushes or flowers near the governor’s quarters, though
carefully persisted in for some time, proved an utter failure. For
his supplies the Mudir is entirely dependent on the arrival of the
government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> steamer
every second month; and if, as had happened at the time of our
visit, this steamer was late, the unfortunate gentleman becomes
comparatively thin from sheer starvation. Except for occasional
travellers or prospectors no white men ever visit Kossair; though
if there is cholera at Mecca an English doctor is sometimes sent to
prevent the disease from passing into Egypt along this route.
Letters and telegrams are every week conveyed across the desert by
an express rider to Keneh, and an answer to a telegram might be
expected in about a week.</p>

<p>A large sea-water distillery, set up some twelve or fourteen
years ago, provides the town with pure water; but so few are the
inhabitants that it is only worked twice a month. This good supply
of water is largely responsible for the lack of sickness in the
town. During the last four years only twenty persons have died, and
of these ten were very young children and ten very old people.
During these years the serious illnesses have only consisted of two
cases of diphtheria: there has been no cholera, enteric, dysentery,
or plague. Many of the inhabitants live to be centenarians, and in
the town we saw several tottering old Methuselahs, who looked as
though the gods of the underworld had forgotten them utterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
</p>

<p>Of sports there are none for the Mudir to indulge in. There is
no shooting; he cannot bathe even if he desired to, because of the
sharks; there are no boats to sail in worthy the names; he cannot
leave his post to make camel trips to interesting localities, even
if that amused him, which it does not; and the one pastime, the
catching of crayfish on the coral reefs, bores him to distraction.
The climate is so monotonously perfect that it does not form a
topic even of thought: in winter it is mild and sunny, in summer it
is mild and sunnier. It is never very cold nor very hot, except for
the few days in summer when a hot east wind is blowing. The Mudir
says that he neither increases nor decreases the amount of his
clothing the whole year round, but always he wears his
underclothes, his tight white-duck tunic, his loose white-duck
trousers, his elastic-sided boots, and his red <i>tarbush</i> or
fez.</p>

<p>After breakfast next morning we walked along the beach to the
stiff, mustard-coloured government buildings, which stand on a
point of land projecting somewhat into the sea. A spick-and-span
pier and quay, ornamented with three or four old French cannon and
some neat piles of cannonballs, gave us the impression that we had
been transported suddenly to a second-rate English<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> watering-place; but passing into
the building that impression was happily removed at once. Through
the sunny courtyard we went, and up the stair, saluted at intervals
by the coastguardsmen, who had donned their best uniforms for the
occasion, and at last we were ushered into the presence of our
Maltese friend, now seated in state at his office table at the far
end of a large airy room. The windows overlooked the glorious blue
sea, and the breath of an English summer drifted into the room,
bringing with it the sigh of the waves. Nothing could have been
more entrancing than the soft air and the sun-bathed scene, but to
the Mudir it was anathema, and his back was resolutely turned to
the windows.</p>

<p>After coffee and a brief conversation we were taken to see the
water distillery, of which the town is immensely proud; and from
thence we were conducted to the chief mosque of the place, a
picturesque old building which has seen better days. We were
readily admitted by the Reader, who, however, turned up the grass
matting which covered the floor in order, so the Mudir said, that
our feet might not be dirtied by it, but in reality in order that
the footstep of a Christian should not defile it. A few men were
praying languidly at one side of the building, and in the opposite
corner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span> a man lay
snoring upon his back. There was the silence of sleep upon the
place, and, returning to the almost deserted lanes between the
houses outside, there was hardly a sound to disturb the stillness
of the morning. In the bazaar a few people were gathered around the
two or three shops, at which business had nigh ceased. A
limp-limbed jeweller was attempting to sell a rough silver ring to
a yawning youth, and, if I am not mistaken, a young girl who
watched the transaction with very mild interest from the opposite
side of the road was to be the recipient of the jewel. Soon we
passed the open door of the schoolroom, where a dozen children
chanted their A B C in a melancholy minor; and presently we came to
the chief sight of Kossair—the old fortress built by the French at
the end of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>One enters the building through a masonry archway, closed by a
heavy wooden door clamped with iron. There are still three or four
cannon inside it to tell of its past life, but now the rooms and
courts are whitewashed and are used as camel stables by the
coastguards. I have no books here in Upper Egypt which will tell me
the details of the Anglo-French struggle for the possession of
Kossair, and I must therefore leave it to my readers to correct my
ignorant statements. It<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_80">[80]</span> appears, then, that a French force occupied
the fortress during the time of Napoleon’s rule in Egypt, and that
one fine day in the year 1800 there came sailing over the sea a
squadron of English men-o’-war, which landed a storming party so
formidable that the French were constrained to evacuate the place
and to retreat across the desert to Keneh. With the English force
there were a large body of Indian troops, and these were marched
across to the Nile in pursuit of the French; but ere more serious
operations had taken place the capitulation of Napoleon’s army
brought the campaign to a close. It is said that when the Indian
soldiers saw representation of the sacred cow of Hathor upon the
walls of the temples of Koptos and Kus, they fell upon their knees
and did obeisance as in their own temples.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Kossair live to such an age and in such
stagnation that the stirring events of these old days are still
talked of, and Englishmen are here still endowed with the prestige
of conquerors. Involuntarily one held one’s head higher as an old
Shêkh pointed out the gate through which the French fled, and that
through which the English bluejackets entered; and, walking through
the quiet streets back to the tents, one gave a nautical hitch to
the trousers, talked contemptuously<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_81">[81]</span> of “Boney,” discussed the plans of Lord
Nelson, named the yawning natives whom we passed “lazy lubbers,”
murmured “Shiver my timbers,” called one another “me hearty,” and,
in a word, acted faithlessly to the <i>entente cordiale</i>.</p>

<p>In camp the remainder of the day was spent in that vague
pottering which the presence of the sea always induces. There were
some beautiful shells upon the shore to attract one, and natives
brought others for sale, lying down to sleep in the shade of the
kitchen tent until we deigned to give them attention. There were
sketches to be made and photographs to be taken. Amidst the houses
at the south end of the town some fragments of a Ptolemaic temple
were stumbled upon, and the inscriptions thereon had to be copied.
These were too fragmentary to be of much importance, and, except
for the above-mentioned ancient name of Kossair there written, no
point of particular interest requires to be noted here. We lunched
and dined off the most excellent fish, a species named
<i>belbul</i> being particularly palatable, while crayfish and a
kind of cockles were immoderately indulged in. Having arranged to
try our hand at the catching of crayfish during the night hours, we
turned in early to sleep for a short time until the fishermen
should call us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
</p>

<p>The summons having come at about 11 <span class=
"sc2">P.M.</span>, we set out along the moonlit shore, two
fishermen and a boy accompanying us, carrying nets and lanterns.
Our destination was a spot at which the coral reefs, projecting
into the sea, presented so flat a surface that the incoming tide
would wash over the whole area at a depth of not more than a few
inches. In the shallow water, we were told, the crayfish would
crawl, attracted by our lanterns, and we could then pick them up
with our fingers. These crayfish are not at first sight
distinguishable from larger lobsters, though a second glance will
show that the difference lies in the fact that they have no claws,
and therefore can be caught with impunity. They are
fearsome-looking creatures, nevertheless, often measuring twenty
inches or so from head to tail. In eating them it is hard to
believe that one is not eating the most tasty of lobsters.</p>

<p>A tedious walk of over three miles somewhat damped our ardour;
and as the fishermen told us that the moon was too high and the
tide too low for good hunting, we were not in the best spirits when
at last we turned on to the coral reef. Here, however, the scene
was so weirdly picturesque that the catching of the crayfish became
a matter of secondary import. The surface of the reef,
though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> flat, was
broken and jagged, and much seaweed grew upon it. In the uncertain
light of the moon it was difficult to walk without stumbling; but
the ghostly figures of the fishermen hovered in front of us, and
silently led the way out towards the sea, which uttered
continuously a kind of sobbing as it washed over the edges of the
coral reef. This and the unholy wail of the curlews were the only
sounds, for the fishermen had imposed silence upon us, and the
moonlight furthered their wishes.</p>

<p>As we walked over the reef we had to pick our way between
several small patches of water some five or six feet in breadth,
which appeared to be shallow pools left by the last tide in the
slight depressions of the rock. Presently one noticed that in these
pools white clouds appeared to be reflected from the sky, but
quickly looking up one saw that the heavens were cloudless. Staring
closer at the water, it suddenly dawned upon one that these white
clouds were in reality the sand at the bottom of the pools, and as
suddenly came the discovery that that bottom lay at a depth of
fifteen feet or more. Now one went on hands and knees to gaze down
at those moonlit depths, and one realised that each pool was a
great globular cavern, the surface area being but the small mouth
of it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> One found
oneself kneeling on a projecting ridge of coral which was deeply
undermined all round; and, looking down into the bowl, one was
reminded of nothing so much as of an aquarium tank seen through
glass. In the moonlight the cloudy bottom of the caverns could be
discerned, whereon grew great anemones and the fair flowers of the
sea. Sometimes an arched gallery, suffused with pale light, led
from one cavern to the next, the ceiling of these passages
decorated with dim plants, the floor with coloured shells. Not
easily could one have been carried so completely into the realms of
Fairyland as one was by the gazing at these depths. Presently there
sailed through the still water the dim forms of fishes, and now
through the galleries there moved two shining lamps, as though
carried by the little men of the sea to light them amidst the
anemones. Two more small lamps passed into the cavern and floated
through the water, now glowing amidst the tendrils of the sea
plants, now rising towards the surface, and now sinking again to
the shells, the sand, and the flowers at the bottom.</p>

<p>It was not at once that one could bring oneself to realise that
these lights were the luminous eyes of a strange fish, the name of
which I do not know; but now the fishermen, who had
suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> drawn their
net across the edge of the reef and had driven a dozen leaping
creatures on to the exposed rock, beckoned us to look at this
curious species at close quarters. Their bodies were transparent,
and from around their mouths many filmy tentacles waved. The eyes
were large and brown in colour, and appeared as fantastic stone
orbs set in a glass body. Many other varieties of fish were caught
as the tide came in; but it appeared that the moon was too powerful
for successful sport in regard to the crayfish, and the catch
consisted of but four of these. The sight of the fairy caverns,
however, was entertainment sufficient for one night; and it was
with discontent that one turned away from these fair kingdoms of
the sea to return in the small hours of the morning to the tents.
The moonlight, the sobbing of the ocean, the deep caverns lit by
unearthly lamps, left an impression of unreality upon the mind
which it was not easy to dispel; and one felt that a glance had
been vouchsafed through the forbidden gates, and a glimpse had been
obtained of scenes unthought of since the days of one’s childhood.
Had we also tasted of the lotos, and was this but one of the dreams
of dreamy Kossair?</p>

<p>Upon the following day I rode northwards along the coast to
visit the site of the Ptolemaic port,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_86">[86]</span> which lies about five miles from the modern
town. An hour’s ride against a hard wind brought us to the little
inlet, around which the mounds and potsherds of the town are
scattered. The water in the bay was of the deepest blue; a rolling
plain of yellow sand lay eastwards, backed by the darker ranges of
mountains; and overhead the white clouds raced by. The sea washed
up in a line of white breakers on to a rising bar of sand,
sparkling with a thousand varieties of shells. Behind this bar
there were pools of water passing inland, and here there may have
been an artificial harbour. On the south side of the bay bold rocks
jutted into the sea, and on the north there rose a series of mounds
upon which the remains of the old town were strewn. Walking over
these mounds, where the rhythmic roar of the waves falls
continuously upon the ears, one’s mind was filled with thoughts of
the ancient port which has so utterly fallen, and of that ancient
commerce with the East which must have been so full of adventure
and romance to the men of old. Here from these mounds the
townspeople have watched the great galleys set out over the seas
for the mysterious land of Hind, and have seen the wealth of Pount
and Arabia unloaded upon the quay; and here so many centuries later
the labours of Egyptologists are beginning to permit<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> one to recall something of what
they saw, though the spade of the excavator has not yet touched
this site.</p>

<p>There are two wells within reach of this spot, but both are two
or three hours’ journey away, and the water question must have been
a serious one. The well to the north is named Bir Guah, and the
other to the west is called Bir Mahowatât. This latter is the name
of a tribe of Bedwin living at Suez, who state that they came
originally from El Wij in Arabia. It is interesting to find that a
well here should be named after them, for El Wij is nearly opposite
this point, and one may realise thus what intercourse there is and
always has been between Arabia and Egypt, even as far south as
Kossair.</p>

<p>Returning with the wind at our backs we soon reached Kossair,
and rode through the streets of the sleepy town to our tents. To
tea in the afternoon came the Mudir, who for an hour or so
entertained us with tales of <i>ennui</i>. Kossair fell asleep when
the Roman Empire fell, awoke for a moment in the days of Napoleon,
but slid into slumber once more over a century ago. There was a
time when the east coast steamers used to call here, but now even
they have left the town to its long siesta. As one listened to the
story of decaying trade and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_88">[88]</span> languid idleness the vision of Tennyson’s
lotos-eater was ever in the mind; and one’s sympathy was as
profound for an official stationed here as was one’s envy of the
man who might be permitted to rest himself for awhile from his
labours upon this mild, sunny shore. The Mudir was, at the time of
our visit, anxiously awaiting the tardy arrival of the steamer
which was to take him and his family to Suez for three months’
leave, and his eye fixed itself upon the sea at every pause in the
conversation; and when he bid us farewell at the door of the tent,
it was but to return to his own doorway, where he might watch for
the distant smoke until the sun should set.</p>

<p>Early next morning we commenced the return journey to the Nile.
As we rode away over the sloping sand towards the hills in the west
we turned in our saddles to obtain a last view of the strange
little dream-town which was sinking so surely to its death. The
quiet sea rippled upon the sunlit shore in one long line of blue
from the houses on the north to the Tourquoise Mountains on the
south. Not a trace of smoke nor a sound rose from the town. On the
beach a group of three men lay sleeping with their arms behind
their heads, while two others crouched languidly<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span> on their haunches watching our
disappearing cavalcade. Then, in the silence of the morning, there
came to us on the breeze the soft call to prayer from the minaret
of the mosque. One could not hear the warbled words; but to the
sleeping figures on the beach, one thought, they must surely be
akin to those of the song of the lotos-eaters:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent0">“How sweet it were, hearing the downward
stream,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;With half-shut eyes ever to

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;To hear each other’s whispered

wholly</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;To the influence of mild-minded

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the quay in the far distance we could just discern a portly
white figure gazing steadfastly out to sea to catch the first
glimpse of the steamer which had been awaited so patiently for so
long.</p>

<h2><a id="c4"></a>IV.<br>
THE IMPERIAL PORPHYRY QUARRIES.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Those</span> who have travelled in
Italy, and, in the museums and in the ruins there, have studied the
sculpture and the architectural accessories of the Roman Imperial
age, will be familiar with that magnificent purple stone known as
Imperial Porphyry. It was one of the most highly prized of the
ornamental stones employed by the great artists and architects of
that age of luxury; and the great distance which it had to be
brought, over parched deserts and perilous seas, must have sent its
price up beyond the reach of all save the rulers of the earth.</p>

<p>The quarries from which this porphyry was obtained are situated
in the region known as Gebel Dukhân, “the Hills of Smoke,” in the
Eastern Egyptian Desert, some twenty-seven miles from the Red Sea,
opposite the southern end of the Peninsula of Sinai. Two or
three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span> travellers
during the last century have visited them, and recently the Survey
Department of the Egyptian Government has published a technical
report on the whole district; but with the exception of this and an
article by the German explorer Schweinfurth, the literature on the
subject, such as it is, seems to be more or less untraceable. In
1887 a gentleman of the name of Brindley obtained a concession
there for the re-working of the quarries, but the project fell
through owing to the difficulties of transporting the stone. In
1907 Mr John Wells, the Director of the now defunct Department of
Mines, decided to make an expedition to Gebel Dukhân to report on
the possibilities of reopening the old works; and it was with
considerable pleasure that I received, and found myself able to
accept, his invitation to accompany him, in order to see how far
the Department of Antiquities could concur in the projects of
modern engineers.</p>

<p>We set out from Keneh, a town on the Nile some 400 miles above
Cairo, in the middle of March: a time of year when one cannot be
sure of good weather in Egypt, for the winter and the summer
together fight for the mastery, and the hot south winds vie with
the cold north winds in ferocity. Sand-storms are frequent in the
desert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> in this month,
and these, though seldom dangerous, can be extremely disagreeable.
We were, however, most fortunate in this respect; and, in spite of
the fact that the winds were strong, I do not recall any particular
discomfort experienced from them, though memory brings back the not
rare vision of men struggling with flapping tents and flying ropes.
Our caravan consisted of some fifty camels, of which about
thirty-five carried the baggage and water; a dozen were ridden by
ourselves, Mr Wells’ police, our native assistants, and others; and
two or three belonged to the Shêkh and the guides.</p>

<p>The business of setting out is always trying to the patience.
The camelmen attempt to load their beasts lightly in order that
more may be employed; they dawdle over the packing that the day’s
journey may be short; the camels, unused to their burdens, perform
such antics as may rid them the most quickly of the incubus; the
untried ropes break as the last knot is tied, and the loads fall to
the ground; the riding-camels are too fresh, and, groaning loudly,
revolve in small circles, as though one’s whistle of encouragement
were a waltz. There are no people in the world so slovenly, so
unpractical, or—if one may use a very slang word—so
<i>footling</i>, as the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_93">[93]</span> inhabitants of the Eastern Desert. One has
heard so often of the splendid desert tribes, of fine figures and
flashing eyes, of dignity and distinction, of gracious manners and
lofty words, that one has come to expect the members of one’s
caravan to be as princely as they are picturesque. It is with a
shock that one finds them to be but ragged weaklings, of low
intelligence and little dignity. Is this, one asks, the proud Bedwi
whose ears are now being boxed by one’s servant? And are these the
brave sons of the desert who are being kicked into shape by that
smart negro policeman, the son of slaves? Look now, eight or ten of
the Bedwin have quarrelled over their camels, and are feeling for
their knives in preparation for a fight: shall we not see some
stirring action, redolent of the brave days of old? No; the black
policeman seizes his camel-whip and administers to as many as he
can catch of the flying wretches as sound a beating as any naughty
boys might receive. Lean-faced, hungry-eyed, and rather upright in
carriage, one may expect them to be quick-witted and endowed with
common-sense. Yet of all stupid people these unwashed miseries are
the stupidest; and as one sees them at the starting of a caravan,
muddling the ropes, upsetting the loads, yawning, scratching
themselves, squabbling<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_94">[94]</span> in high, thin voices, and tripping over their
antiquated swords and long guns, one’s dream of the Bedwin in this
part of the desert fades and no more returns.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, it is the point of view which is at fault. Did
one live in the desert without a deed to do or a thought to think
beyond those connected with the little necessities of life, and
with so vague a knowledge of time and distance as such an existence
requires, one’s notion of the practical might be different, and
one’s idea of intelligence might be less lofty. Perhaps, too, one
has not yet met with the genuine types of the race; for the
camel-drivers employed by an economical Shêkh, and the goatherds
who wander through the valleys, may be but the riff-raff cast off
from the more remote tribes. Moreover, there are a few exceptions
to the general rule which may be met with even amongst the
camelmen, but these are hardly sufficiently notable to record.</p>

<p>At last a start was made; and riding north-eastwards over the
hot, sandy plain, we trotted slowly towards the distant limestone
hills which rose above a shifting mirage of lake-like vapour. For
some miles our road led over the hard, flat desert; but opportunely
at the lunching hour we passed a spur of rock which afforded
welcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> shade, and
here we rested for an hour or so. At this point there is a well,
known as Bir Arras, rather prettily situated amidst tamarisk-bushes
and desert scrub; but as it is only ten miles distant from Keneh it
is not much used by travellers. Riding on in the afternoon, we
verged somewhat to the left, and passed along a valley much broken
up by low mounds of sand collected round the decayed roots of
bushes; and here several thriving tamarisks and other small trees
lent colour to the scene. Soon we turned again to the left, and
presently crossed two projecting spurs of the low hills, upon which
beacons of stone had been erected in Roman days, on either side of
the track, to mark the road. It is interesting to find that along
the whole length of the route from Keneh to the quarries these
piles of stone have been placed at irregular intervals in order
that the traveller should have no difficulty in finding his way.
Towards evening the tracks led us up the clearly marked bed of a
dry river, bordered by tamarisks and other bushes; and, passing
along this for a short distance, we called a halt, and pitched the
tents amongst the sand hillocks to one side. The following morning
we were on the road soon after sunrise; and, riding along the dry
river-bed, we presently reached the Roman station<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> of El Ghaiteh, which lies, in
all, some seven and a half hours’ trot from Keneh. This is the
first of the Roman posts on the road from Keneh to Gebel Dukhân,
and here the ancient express caravans halted for the night. At the
foot of a low hill there is a fortified rectangular enclosure, in
which several rooms with vaulted roofs are built. The walls are
constructed of broken stones, and still stand some twelve feet or
more in height. The entrance is flanked by round towers, and
passing through it one sees on the left a large tank, built of
burnt bricks and cement, in which the water, brought from the well
in the plain, was stored. Just to the north of the station there
are the ruins of the animal lines, where rough stone walls have
been built on a well-ordered plan, forming a courtyard in which the
stalls run in parallel rows. Above the enclosure, on the hill-top,
there are some carefully constructed buildings of sun-dried brick,
which may have been the officers’ quarters. Resting in the shade of
the ruins, one’s eye wandered over the sun-burnt desert to the hazy
hills beyond, and thence back along the winding river-bed to the
bushes at the foot of the hill, where the camels lazily cropped the
dry twigs, and where green dragon-flies hovered against the
intensely blue sky. Then<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_97">[97]</span> again the ruins claimed one’s attention, and
presently one seemed to forget the things of the present time, and
to drift back to the days when the blocks of Imperial Porphyry were
heaved and hoisted, carried and dragged along this road to the Nile
and to Rome.</p>

<p>A ride of somewhat over three hours across wide, undulating,
gravel plains brought us to the next Roman station, known as Es
Sargieh, which lies between two low mounds just to the north of the
main track. Here a large excavation has been made in order to
obtain water, and at its edge there are the remains of troughs and
tanks constructed of brick and cement. The sand and clay from the
excavation has been thrown up in an embankment, so as to form a
rectangular enclosure. At one end there are the ruins of a few
chambers, and the animal lines near by are clearly marked. Es
Sargieh marks the point where the road divides, one track leading
to Gebel Dukhân, and the other to the white granite quarries of Um
Etgal; and it was thus an important watering-station.</p>

<p>From this point for the rest of the day our road lay across a
hard flat plain, bounded in the distance ahead by the dim peaks of
granite mountains. As we had stopped some considerable time at the
two Roman ruins, the baggage camels and men had<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> pushed far in advance, and, with
characteristic stupidity, continued to do so, though the sun went
down and the stars came out. It was not till long past dinner-time
that, riding furiously through the darkness, we managed to catch
them up; and hungry, aching, and cross, we quickly devoured a cold
meal and rolled into bed. During the night a gale of wind came near
to overthrowing the tents, for we had bivouacked where we had
overtaken the caravan, upon the exposed plain. The night air felt
bitterly cold as, clad in pyjamas, one pulled at ropes and hammered
at pegs; but it was a surprise to find the thermometer standing at
32° Fahrenheit at this time of year.</p>

<p>Having camped in the darkness, it was not till daybreak that we
realised that we had now crossed the plain, and were already near
the mouth of a valley which led into a region of dark rocks between
two ranges of hills. Not long after sunrise we mounted our camels,
and presently passed into this valley. Jagged cliffs towered above
the road, and behind them the soft brown hills rose in an array of
dimly seen peaks. A ride of two hours up this valley—that is to
say, altogether about five hours’ trot from Es Sargieh—brought us
to the Roman station of El Atrash. There is a fortified enclosure
containing several regularly arranged<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_99">[99]</span> buildings, a tank, and a deep, circular well
constructed of brick. The gateway is flanked by brick towers up
which the steps can still be traced. Outside the enclosure there
are the usual animal lines; and near by there lies a large block of
porphyry which must have been abandoned for some reason on its way
to the river. The scenery here is wild and desolate. There was a
feeling, as the eye passed from range to range of menacing hills
and up to the grey clouded sky, that one was travelling in the
moon. The day was cold and misty, and the sharp air already told of
the altitude to which we had risen—now nearly 2000 feet.</p>

<p>From here the road led through valleys lying between hills of
ever-increasing height. The colour of the rocks now changed from a
deep brown to a kind of soft purple; while the ground over which we
were moving, being composed of particles of red granite, turned to
a curious rosy hue. It was as though one were looking through
tinted glass; and these combinations of colour—the red valley, the
purple hills, and the grey sky—gave to the scene a beauty
indescribable.</p>

<p>We lunched in the shadow of the rocks, and sleeping on the
ground thereafter one’s dreams were in mauves and
burnt-siennas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
</p>

<p>Mounting again and riding along this wonderful valley, feeling
more than ever like Mr H. G. Wells’ men in the moon, early in the
afternoon we reached the Roman station of Wady Gatâr, which lies in
a hollow amidst lofty hills, some three and a half hours’ ride from
El Atrash. The station consists, as before, of an enclosure,
chambers, disused well, and animal lines; but it is more ruined
than the other posts which we had seen. There is a well not far
from this point, to which the camels were sent to be watered; and
we were thus able to spend a quiet afternoon in our camp amongst
the hills.</p>

<p>Towards sunset I climbed to the top of a low mound of rocks
which overlooked the fortress, and there the silence of the evening
and the strangeness of the surrounding hues enhanced to a point
almost of awe the sense of aloofness which this part of the desert
imposes upon one. On the right the line of a valley drew the eyes
over the dim, brown waves of gravel to the darkness of the rugged
horizon. Behind, and sweeping upward, the sky was a golden red; and
this presently turned to green, and the green to deep blue. On the
left some reflected light tinged the eastern sky with a suggestion
of purple, and against this the nearer mountains stood out darkly.
In front the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> low
hills met together, and knit themselves into shapes so strange that
one might have thought them the distortions of a dream. There was
not a sound to be heard, except once when an unseen flight of
migratory birds passed with a soft <i>whir</i> high overhead. The
light was dim,—too dark to read the book which I carried. Nor was
there much desire to read; for the mind was wandering, as the eyes
were, in an indistinct region of unrealities, and was almost silent
of thought.</p>

<p>Then in the warm, perfect stillness, with the whole wilderness
laid prone in that listless haze which anticipates the dead sleep
of night, there came—at first almost unnoticed—a small, black,
moving mass, creeping over an indefinite hill-top. So silently it
appeared, so slowly moved nearer, that one was inclined to think it
a part of the dream, a vague sensation passing across the solemn,
sleepy mind of the desert. Presently, very quietly, the mass
resolved itself into a compact flock of goats. Now it was drawing
nearer, and one could discern with some degree of detail the little
procession—the procession of dream-ideas one might have said, for
it was difficult to face facts in the twilight. Along the valley it
moved, and, fluttering in the wind, there arose a plaintive
bleating and the wail of the goatherd’s pipe. He—one could see
him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> now—was walking
in advance of his flock, and his two hands held a reed from which
he was pouring the ancient melodies of his race. From the hill-top
I could soon look down on the flock as it passed below. It had
become brown in colour; and as the pipe ceased awhile the shuffle
and patter of a hundred little creatures could be heard. It was a
gentle sound, more inclined to augment than to diminish the dreamy
character of the procession. Behind the flock two figures moved,
their white garments fluttering in the wind, changing grotesquely
the form and shape of the wearers. Over the gravel they went, and
at a distance followed the dogs of the herd, growling as they
passed. Over the gravel and down the valley, and with them went the
gentle patter and the wandering refrain of the reed pipe. Then a
bend in the path, or may be the fading of the dream, and the flock
was seen no more. But in the darkness which had gathered one was
almost too listless to feel that aught had passed beyond one’s
pale.</p>

<p>We left Wady Gatâr the next day soon after lunch and entered
another fine valley. On the right the granite cliffs sloped up to
the misty sky in clean, sheer faces of rock. On the left range
after range of dimly peaked hills carried one’s<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> thoughts into the clouds. The
afternoon was sunless and the air bracing and keen. The camels,
after their long drink, were ready for work, and we were soon
swinging up the valley at a brisk trot. The road turned from side
to side, now leading in a dozen clear tracks up the wide, gravelled
bed of some forgotten torrent, and now passing in a single narrow
path from one valley to the next. With every turn new groups of
mountains became visible and higher peaks slid into sight. The
misty air lent a softness to these groups, blending their varied
colours into almost celestial harmonies of tone. Gradually the
ranges mounted, until at last, as the afternoon began to draw in,
the towering purple mountains of Gebel Dukhân rose from behind the
dark rocks to the left of our road.</p>

<p>It was almost sunset before we reached the foot of this range,
and the cloudy sun was passing behind the more distant hills as a
halt was called. We were now in a wide, undulating valley, which
was hemmed in by the superb mountains on three sides and disclosed
low, open country towards the north-east. The beams of the hidden
sun shot up from behind the dark hills in a sudden glare of
brightness, and presently the clouded sky turned to a deep crimson.
The lofty peaks of the southern<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_104">[104]</span> mountains now caught the disappearing
sunshine and sprang out of the mist in a hundred points of vivid
red. For only a few minutes the conflagration lasted, but before it
had fully died out the vaporous outlines in the far distance
towards the north-east took form and colour, and the last gleam of
sunlight revealed, some twenty miles away, the thin line of the
sea, and above it the stately mountains of Sinai. A moment later
the vision had passed, the sun had set, and in the gathering
darkness the baggage camels, lumbering round a bend, came into
sight, calling our attention to more material things.</p>

<p>In the semi-darkness, while our meal was being prepared, we
visited a Roman station which stands in the Wady Bileh at the foot
of the Gebel Dukhân mountains, about three and a quarter hours’
trot from the fortress of Wady Gatâr. The porphyry quarries and the
settlement lay in the valley at the other side of the range of
hills at the foot of which we were now standing; and to reach them
one might either climb by an ancient path over a pass in the range,
or one might ride round by the tortuous valley—a journey said to be
of nearly thirty miles. This station was thus the first night’s
halting-place for express caravans returning from the quarries. At
one side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
wide, ancient road stands the usual small enclosure, having a
doorway flanked with towers, and containing a few ruined chambers
and a well. At the other side a cluster of granite rocks rising
into a small mound had been surrounded by a stout wall, either in
order that it should serve as a fortress, or because these rocks
were for some reason sacred. There was nothing particularly
noteworthy about the station, but, lying amidst such wild and
magnificent scenery, it assumed in the half-light a charm which
will not soon be forgotten.</p>

</div>

<p>At dawn next morning we set out on foot to climb over the pass
to the quarries. The sun was struggling to penetrate the soft mists
as we started the actual ascent, and the air was cold and
invigorating. Here and there one could detect the old Roman path
passing up the hillside, but it was so much broken that a climb up
the dry watercourse, across which it zigzagged, was preferable. At
the immediate foot of the pass there is a small Roman fort
containing three or four rooms, and at the highest point, which is
3150 feet above sea-level, there is a ruined rest-house, where the
tired climber, no doubt, was able to obtain at least a pot of
water. Here at the summit we had a wonderful view of the
surrounding country. Behind us the mountains rose in a series of
misty ranges, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
before us lay the valley of Gebel Dukhân winding between the
porphyry hills, while beyond them the northern mountains rose to
some 6000 feet in the distance. The Roman road, descending on this
side, was well preserved, and we were able to run down the 1200
feet or so, which brought us breathless to the level of the valley.
The temple, town, and quarries lay about a mile down the Wady, at a
point where there was a considerable breadth of flat gravel between
the hills on either side.</p>

<p>The town ruins—a cluster of crowded houses enclosed by a
fortified wall—stand on the slope of the hill. A fine terrace runs
along the east side, and up to this a ramp ascends. Passing through
the gateway one enters the main street, and the attention is first
attracted by an imposing building on the right hand. Here there are
several chambers leading into an eight-pillared hall, at the end of
which a well-made and well-preserved plunge-bath eloquently tells
of the small pleasures of expatriated Roman officers. A turning
from the main street brings one into an open courtyard, where there
are two ovens and some stone dishes to be seen, besides a large
quantity of pottery fragments. Around this in every direction the
little huts are huddled, narrow lanes dividing one set of chambers
from the next. The town is, of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_107">[107]</span> course, very ruined; but it does not
require much imagination to people it again with that noisy crowd
of Greek, Roman, and Egyptian quarrymen. One sees them prising out
the blocks of purple porphyry from the hillside high above the
valley, returning in the evening down the broad causeway to the
town, or passing up the steps to the temple which stands on a knoll
of granite rocks a couple of hundred yards to the north-east.</p>

<p>The steps lead one up to a platform which formed the forecourt
of the temple. This court is now covered with the ruins of what was
once a fine granite portico rising on the east side. Four columns
supported an inscribed architrave and decorated cornice, above
which was the pediment or pointed roof. Behind this portico stood
the sanctuary, built of broken stones carefully mortared and
plastered to the necessary smoothness. A granite doorway led from
one side into the vestry. In the forecourt, amidst the ruins,
stands the granite altar, in its original position; and near it
lies the architrave with the proud inscription: “For the safety and
the eternal victory of our Lord Cæsar Trajan Hadrian, absolute,
august, and all his house; to the Sun, the great Serapis, and to
the co-enshrined gods, this temple, and all that is in it, is
dedicated.” Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
follow the names of the Governor of Egypt, the Superintendent of
the Mines, and other officials.</p>

<p>In the middle of the valley there is the well, which is now
choked. A gallery, the roof of which was supported by five pillars,
passes in a half-circle round one side of the well; and a shallow
drain in the pavement seems to have carried a stream of water along
it. Here the workmen could sit in the shade to ease the thirst
which exercise on the hot hills so soon creates; and on our return
journey up the pass we looked back more than once to this cool
gallery and to the plunge-bath with a kind of envy of the past.</p>

<p>The quarries are cut here and there on the hillside without any
regularity. The blocks of porphyry were prised out of the rock
wherever the work could most easily be carried on, and the action
of the years has so dulled the broken surfaces that they now look
almost like those of the natural mountain. The blocks were carried
down to the Nile, and in fact to Rome, in the rough, without even a
preliminary dressing; for the work in this distant place had to be
shortened as much as possible.</p>

<p>Looking, in the European museums, at the fine capitals, the
polished basins, the statues, and the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_109">[109]</span> many other objects cut out of Imperial
Porphyry, one has admired the work of the mason or the genius of
the artist. But here in the Hills of Smoke one thinks of these
antiquities with a feeling bordering on veneration. If the
workmanship tells of an art that is dead, how much louder does the
material cry out the praises of an energy that is also dead? Each
block of stone is the witness of a history of organisation and
activity almost beyond thought. This purple porphyry was not known
to the ancient Egyptians: a Roman prospector must have searched the
desert to find it. One would have thought that the aloofness of the
valley from which it is to be procured would have kept its
existence the secret of the hills; for on the one side a winding
pathway, thirty miles in length, separates the spot from the
little-known main road, and on the other side a barrier of steep
hills shuts it off from the Wady Bileh.</p>

<p class="left sc">Pl. xviii.</p>
</div>

<p>Although Gebel Dukhân is so near the Red Sea, it was not
possible for the stone to be transported by ship to Suez. The
barren coast here was harbourless, except for the port of Myos
Hormos, which was too far away to be practicable; and the stone
would have had to be unloaded at Suez, and dragged across the
desert to the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_110">[110]</span> of the modern Port Said. Every block of
porphyry had therefore to be carried across the desert to Keneh,
the old Kainepolis, on the Nile, and thence shipped by river-barge
to the sea. Here it had to be transhipped to the great
Mediterranean galleys, and thus conveyed across the treacherous sea
to the port of Rome.</p>

<p>Probably the blocks were dragged by oxen or men upon rough
waggons, for the roads are not bad, except at certain places. To
ride from Keneh to Wady Bileh, at the quiet five-miles-an-hour trot
of the camel, took us altogether twenty-two and a half hours; that
is to say, the total distance is about 112 miles or so. The winding
path from Wady Bileh up the valley to the quarries brings this
total to about 140 miles; and the caravans could not have covered
this in less than eight days. On the first night after leaving
Keneh the camp was probably pitched in the open. On the second
night the station of El Ghaiteh was reached, and here there were
provisions, water, and a small garrison. The third night was spent
at Es Sargieh, where water was to be obtained. On the fourth night
the houses of El Atrash sheltered the travellers, water and
provisions being here obtainable. On the fifth night Wady Gatâr was
reached, where again there was a well.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_111">[111]</span> The sixth night was passed at Wady Bileh,
from whence express messengers could pass over the hill to the
quarries. The seventh night was spent in the open, and on the
following day the settlement was reached.</p>

<p>The long road was rendered dangerous by the incursions of the
desert peoples, and many of the hills between the fortified
stations are crowned with ruined watch-towers. Roman troops must
have patrolled the road from end to end, and the upkeep of these
garrisons must have been a considerable expense. The numerous
stone-cutters and quarrymen had to be fed and provided for; and for
this purpose an endless train of supplies had to be brought from
the Nile valley. Oxen or donkeys for this purpose, and for the
transporting of the porphyry, had to be kept constantly on the
move. At Keneh a service of barges had to be organised, and at the
seaport the galleys had to be in readiness to brave the seas with
their heavy loads.</p>

<p>It is of all this—of the activity, the energy, the bravery, the
power of organisation, the persistency, the determination—that an
object executed in Imperial Porphyry tells the story.</p>

<p>The quarries were worked until about the fifth century
<span class="sc2">A.D.</span>, for the Byzantine Emperors
derived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span> from their
Roman predecessors an affection for this fine purple stone. There
is a Greek inscription on the path leading up to one of the
workings, which reads, “Katholeke Ekklesia,” and which is perhaps
the latest example of old-world activity in the Eastern Desert.
There is no other place in the world where this porphyry is to be
found, and when the quarries at last ceased to be worked, some time
previous to the seventh century, the use of that stone had to cease
also, nor has it ever again been procurable.</p>

<p>One wonders whether there will come a time when some
millionaire, fresh from the museums of Italy, will express a wish
to pave his bathroom with the purple stone of the Emperors; and
whether the Hills of Smoke will again ring with the sound of the
hammer and chisel, in response to the demands of a new fashion.</p>

<p>It may be that some day the tourist will awake to the advantages
and attractions of the Eastern Desert as a motoring country, will
rush through the wadys, will visit the ancient centres of activity,
will see these quarries, and will desire the porphyry. With a
little preparation the road from Keneh to Gebel Dukhân could be
made practicable for automobiles; and when once the land ceases to
be but the territory of the explorer and the
prospector,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span> one may
expect its mineral products to be seen, to be talked of, and
finally to be exploited.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon we left the valley, and climbed slowly up
the Roman road to the summit of the pass, halting here to drink
deeply from our water-bottles. The descent down the dry watercourse
was accomplished in a long series of jumps from boulder to boulder,
at imminent peril of a sprained ankle. The grey rocks were smooth
and slippery, and between them there grew a yellow-flowered weed
which, when trodden upon, was as orange-peel. The rapid rush down
the hillside, the setting sun, and the bracing wind, caused our
return to camp to take its place amongst the most delightful
memories of the whole expedition. Once we halted, and borrowing the
carbines of the native police, we shot a match of half a dozen
rounds apiece, with a spur of stone as target. The noise echoed
amongst the rocks; and a thousand feet below we saw the ant-like
figures of our retainers anxiously hurrying into the open to
ascertain the cause of the disturbance.</p>

<p>As we neared the bottom of the hill the sun set, and once more
this wonderful valley was lit with the crimson afterglow, and once
more the mountains of Sinai stood out for a moment from the
gathering mists above the vivid line of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_114">[114]</span> Red Sea. Darkness had fallen when at
last, footsore and weary, we reached the camp; and one was almost
too tired to enjoy the sponge-down in the half-basin of water which
is all that can be allowed in this waterless region, and the meal
of tinned food which followed. As one fell to sleep that night,
one’s dreams were all of strenuous labours: of straining oxen and
sweating men; of weary marches and unsuspected ambushes; of the
sand-banks of the Nile and the tempests of the sea. But ever in the
far distance one seemed to be conscious of thoughtless, implacable
men, dipping their bejewelled fingers into the basins of purple
porphyry as they reclined in the halls of Imperial Rome.</p>

<p>On the following morning our party divided, Mr Wells and the
greater part of the caravan going north-east to the petroleum wells
of Gebel Zeit on the sea-coast, and I to Um Etgal, the Mons
Claudianus of the ancients, where the white granite, also so much
admired by the Romans, was quarried from the hillside.</p>

<h2><a id="c5"></a>V.<br>
THE QUARRIES OF MONS CLAUDIANUS.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">In</span> the previous chapter an
account was given of a journey made to the Imperial porphyry
quarries of Gebel Dukhân in the month of March 1907. These quarries
are to be found about a score or so of miles from the Red Sea at a
point in the Eastern Desert opposite the southern end of the
Peninsula of Sinai. From Gebel Dukhân I returned to the Nile by way
of the white granite quarries of Um Etgal, the ancient Mons
Claudianus, and thence past the old gold workings of Fatireh to
Keneh.</p>

<p>My caravan was composed of a riding party consisting of myself,
my native assistant, my servant, and a guide; and the baggage-train
of a dozen camels and men, and a couple of guards. The guide was a
picturesque, ragged old man, whose face was wizen and wrinkled by
the glare of the desert. His camel was decked with swinging tassels
of black and yellow, and across his<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_116">[116]</span> saddle there was slung a gun at least seven
feet long, while at his side there hung a broad-bladed sword in an
old red-leather case. In his belt there were two knives, and in his
hand he carried a stout bludgeon, something in the form of a
hockey-stick. This latter is the weapon most generally carried by
the Ababdeh and other desert peoples, and its antiquity is
evidenced by the fact that the earliest hieroglyph for “a soldier”
in the script of ancient Egypt represents a figure holding just
such a stick.</p>

<p>The old guide was followed by three lean, yellow dogs, who
seemed to be much bored by the journey and dejected by the
sterility around. He was a man of some dignity, and took
considerable pride in riding at the head of the little procession
in order to show the way, although, except at the cross-roads, the
tracks were perfectly plain and the ancient beacons were generally
to be seen. Once or twice I made an attempt to pass him so that I
might have an uninterrupted view of the scenery; for the sight of a
ragged, huddled back and the hindquarters of a betasseled camel is
inclined to pall after a while. But these efforts ended in a short,
hard race, in which I was generally the loser; nor had I the heart
to order the old man to the rear thereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
</p>

<p>We set out from the camp at Wady Bileh, the nearest point to
Gebel Dukhân on the main road, soon after daybreak, and passed
along the wonderful valley leading back to the Roman station of
Wady Gatâr, which I have already described, our route branching off
towards the south just before reaching that place. The road then
led along a fine valley, up which a blustering north wind went
whistling, and it was only by donning an overcoat and by trotting
at a smart pace that one could pretend to feel comfortably warm.
Soon after noon I halted near some thorn-trees, in the shelter of
which luncheon was presently spread. A vulture circling overhead
watched our party anxiously, in the vain hope that somebody would
drop dead, but on seeing us mount again to continue the journey it
sailed away disgustedly over the windy hill-top.</p>

<p>It was still cold and stormy when, after trotting altogether for
five hours from Wady Bileh, we arrived at the well of Um Disi,
where the camp was pitched in order that the camels might drink and
graze. The well is the merest puddle in the sand amidst the smooth
boulders of a dry watercourse, hidden under the overhanging cliffs
of granite. It lies in the corner of a wide amphitheatre of gravel
and sand, completely shut in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_118">[118]</span> by the mountains. Bushes of different kinds
grow in great profusion over this amphitheatre, and from the tent
door, when the eye was tired of wandering upon the many-coloured
hills, one might stare in a lazy dream at a very garden of
vegetation, around which the grey wagtails flitted and the
dragon-flies slowly moved. It is an ideal place for a camp, and one
but wished that more than a night could have been spent there; for
one would have liked to have explored the surrounding hills and
valleys, and to have stalked the gazelle which had left their
footprints near the well.</p>

<p>The nights up here in this locality, which must be some 1500 or
more feet above the sea, were bitterly cold, in spite of the
approaching summer. There is perhaps no place where one more keenly
feels a low temperature than in the desert; and here at Um Disi,
where the air is that of the mountains, a colder night was passed
than it has ever been my lot to endure—with the exception, perhaps,
of one occasion some years ago when, with another student of
archæology, I spent the night upon the flint-covered hill-tops of
the Western Desert. Our baggage and bedding had then failed to
reach us, and we were obliged to sleep in our clothes and
overcoats, dividing a newspaper to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_119">[119]</span> act as a cover for the neck and ears. By
midnight we were so cold that we were forced to dance a kind of
hornpipe in order to set the circulation going again in the veins;
and my friend was light-hearted enough to accompany this war-dance
with a breathless rendering of the hymn, “We are but little
children meek,” which had been dinned into his head, he told me,
while staying at a mission school in another part of Egypt. Memory
recalls the scene of the dark figure shuffling and swaying in the
clear starlight, the biting wind whistling around the rocks in
rhythmless accompaniment; and yet it does not seem that so much
discomfort was then felt as was experienced in the flapping tent at
Um Disi.</p>

<p>The journey was continued early next morning, the road leading
out from the amphitheatre through a gauge on the eastern side.
There was now some difficulty about the method of travelling, for
only the guide knew the way; and as he rode with us, there was
danger of our losing the slowly moving baggage camels, which always
followed behind, catching us up at our halts for luncheon and other
refreshment. I therefore took with me some bags of torn paper, and
at every turning of the path, or at the cross-tracks, I threw
down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> a few handfuls
in the manner of a paper-chase; and thus, though the path here
wound from one valley to another in the most perplexing manner, the
caravan reached its destination almost as soon as we.</p>

<p>It was disappointing to find that our camelmen, born and bred in
the desert, were unwilling to take the responsibility of following
safely in our tracks. One would have thought that the footprints of
our camels would have been as easy for them to trace on an
unfrequented path as torn paper is to us. The guide, on the other
hand, showed a really wonderful knowledge of the intricate paths;
for it is not reasonable to suppose that he had travelled between
Gebel Dukhân and Um Etgal more than two or three times in his life,
this being off the main routes through the desert. He did not once
hesitate or look around, although when questioned he declared that
many years had passed since last he had been here.</p>

<p>In these valleys we met, for the first time for some days, one
or two Bedwin. A ragged figure, carrying a battle-axe and a
mediæval sword, sprang up from the rocks, where he was tending a
flock of goats, and hurried across to shake hands with our guide.
The two entered into earnest conversation in low tones; and the old
guide,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> after
pointing with his lean finger to his bag of food, which was every
day diminishing in size, and then to the hungry dogs, dismounted
from his camel, tied up one of the dogs, and handed it over to his
wild friend. A few hours later another ragged figure, this time a
Bishari, carrying a long gun, ran forward to greet us, and to him
the guide delivered over his second dog, after a similar discussion
with regard to his food-bag. For over a mile from this point, after
the dog and his new master had diminished to mere specks on the
rocks, the wind brought down to us the melancholy howls of the
former and the unconcerned song of the latter to his goats.</p>

<p>Our way led up the wide Wady Ghrosar, which ends in a pass, from
the top of which a magnificent view is obtained. This point was
reached in a trot of about three and three-quarter hours from Bir
Um Disi. One looks down upon a great lake of sand, amidst which the
groups of dark granite hills rise like a thousand islands, while
dim ranges enclose the scene on all sides. From this huge basin a
hundred valleys seem to radiate, and it would be an easy matter to
head for the wrong peak and to lose oneself upon the undulating
sands. Descending a smooth slope, we rested for luncheon in the
shade of a group of rocks; and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_122">[122]</span> presently mounting our camels again, we
crossed the basin and entered a series of intricate valleys, which
became more and more narrow and enclosed as the day wore on, giving
us good reason to doubt whether our baggage camels would manage to
follow. At last, in the late afternoon, after a ride of rather
under four hours from the top of Wady Ghrosar, a turn in the path
brought the town of Mons Claudianus suddenly into view; and in a
moment the camels were forgotten, and the wonderfully preserved
remains had carried one back to the days of the Emperors Trajan and
Hadrian.</p>

<p>The hills of Um Etgal supplied Rome with a fine white granite
speckled with black, which was deservedly popular for building
purposes during the Imperial age. The stone was not employed by the
ancient Egyptians, and it was left to a Roman prospector to
discover its existence and to open quarries. The settlement which
was founded here was known generally as Mons Claudianus, but in
honour of the Emperor Trajan the well which supplied it with water
was called Fons Trajanus, and this name was sometimes applied to
the town. The stone was transported from here to the Nile on
waggons drawn by oxen or men, and was placed upon barges at Keneh.
It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> was then floated
down the stream to the sea, where it was transhipped to the galleys
which bore it across the Mediterranean to the port of Rome. The
distance from here to the Nile must be about ninety-five miles,
since it took us nearly nineteen hours of five-miles-an-hour
trotting to cover the distance; and, as will be seen, the blocks
which were dispatched from the quarries were of enormous size. It
must have been an easier matter to transport the Imperial Porphyry
from Gebel Dukhân to the river; for the objects executed in that
stone were not usually of a size to require particularly large
blocks. But the great pillars which were cut from the white granite
were often of dimensions which one would have regarded as
prohibitive to transportation. In order to reduce the weight to the
minimum the columns were dressed on the spot to within an inch or
so of their final surface, whereas the porphyry blocks were light
enough to be sent down in the rough. This is the explanation of the
fact that at Gebel Dukhân there was but a small town, whereas here
at Um Etgal the settlement was far more elaborate and extensive.
Skilled masons had to live at Mons Claudianus as well as quarrymen,
engineers as well as labourers; and the architects themselves may
have had to visit the quarries on certain<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_124">[124]</span> occasions. If one has admired the
enterprise which is displayed in the works at Gebel Dukhân, an even
greater call on one’s admiration will be made at Um Etgal; and
those who would fully realise the power of the Roman Empire should
make their slow way to these distant quarries, should realise the
enormous difficulties of their working, and should think for a
moment that all this activity was set in motion by the mere whim of
an Emperor.</p>

<p>The town, enclosed by a buttressed and fortified wall, stands in
a valley between the rocky hills from which the white granite was
quarried. A broad road leads up to the main entrance. On the left
side of this stand various ruined houses, and on the right there is
a large enclosure in which the transport animals were stabled. Over
half this enclosure there was a roof, supported by numerous
pillars; but the other half stands open, and still contains line
upon line of perfectly preserved stalls, at which some 300 oxen or
donkeys could be stabled. Farther up the road, on the opposite
side, just before reaching the entrance to the town, there stands
the bath-house. One first enters a good-sized hall in which three
small granite tanks stand. Here the bathers no doubt washed
themselves before entering the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_125">[125]</span> baths proper. From this silent hall two
doorways open. The first of these leads into a series of three
small rooms which were heated by furnaces in the manner of a
Turkish bath. These chambers seem to have been heated to different
degrees, for under the floor of the innermost there is a large
cavity or cellar for the hot air, whereas in the other rooms there
are only pottery flues, which pass down the walls behind the
plaster. In one chamber there is an arched recess, which seems to
have been made for ornamental purposes. The second doorway from the
hall leads into a fine vaulted room, at the far end of which a
plunge-bath, some nine feet long and four or five feet deep, is
constructed of bricks and cement. Steps lead down into it from the
floor level, and in the walls around there are ornamental niches in
which statuettes or vases may have stood. In this tank the Roman
officer was able to lie splashing after his hot-air bath, and there
is an appearance of luxury about the place which suggests that he
could here almost believe himself in his own country.</p>

</div>

<p class="left sc">Pl. xxi.</p>
</div>

<p>The enclosed town consists of a crowded mass of small houses,
intersected by a main street from which several lanes branch to
right and left. The walls are all built of broken stones, and the
doorways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> are
generally constructed of granite. Some of the roofing is still
intact, and is formed of thin slabs of granite supported by rough
pillars. One wanders from street to street, picking a way here and
there over fallen walls; now entering the dark chambers of some
almost perfectly preserved house, now pausing to look through a
street doorway into the open court beyond. Large quantities of
broken pottery and blue glazed ware lie about, but there did not
seem to be many other antiquities on the surface.</p>

<p>The temple lies outside the town on the hillside to the north. A
flight of ruined steps, some 25 feet in breadth between the
balustrades, leads up to a terrace, on which stands the broken
altar, inscribed as follows: “In the twelfth year of the Emperor
Nerva Trajan Cæsar Augustus Germanicus Dacicus; by Sulpicius
Simius, Prefect of Egypt, this altar was made.” At the north end of
the terrace there is a granite portico, of which the two elegant
columns are now overthrown. Through this one passes into a large
four-pillared hall, where there is another altar, upon which is
written: “Annius Rufus; Legate of the XVth Legion ‘Appolinaris,’
superintending the marble works of Mons Claudianus by the favour of
the Emperor Trajan.” From this hall the sanctuary<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span> and other important rooms
lead. The walls in the various parts of the building now only
appear as orderly piles of rough stones, but when they were neatly
covered with the salmon-coloured plaster, which may be seen in the
bath-house and elsewhere, they must have been most imposing. Built
into one of the outer walls of the temple there is a block of stone
decorated with the well-known Egyptian symbol of the disk and
serpents; and this seems to be the only indication of Egyptian
influence in the place.</p>

<p>To the north-east of the town a great causeway leads up to the
main quarries, and half-way along it lies a huge block of granite,
abandoned for some reason before it had been dragged down to the
depository below. Here at the foot of the causeway lie several huge
columns already trimmed, and many smaller blocks left in the rough.
Most of these are numbered or otherwise marked, and on one enormous
block, hewn into the form of a capital, there is written: “The
property of Cæsar Nerva Trajan.”</p>

<p>The well from which the inhabitants of Mons Claudianus drew
their water lies in a valley nearly a mile from the town. It is
enclosed within a courtyard, and near it stands a round tower some
25 feet in height. From this tower to a point<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_128">[128]</span> about a quarter of a mile from the town
there runs an aqueduct along which the water was evidently sent,
the drop of 25 feet giving it the necessary impetus. At the town
end of the aqueduct there is a building which contains a large tank
and a series of rooms something in the nature of a small barrack.
Here, no doubt, lived the persons who had charge of the
water-supply, and it was probably their duty to see that the tank
was always full. Outside the building there is a trough from which
the animals could drink. One imagines the quarrymen or their wives
coming each day to the tank to fill their amphoræ with water, and
the stablemen leading down the mules or donkeys to the trough.
Here, as in the animal lines at the town, one is struck with the
disciplined system shown in the arrangements, and it seems clear
that the settlement was under the immediate eyes of true Romans,
uninfluenced by the slovenliness of the Orient.</p>

<p>I first saw these ruins in the red light of sunset, and through
the streets of the town I made my way in the silence of nightfall.
No words can record the strangeness of wandering thus through
doorways unbarred since the days of Imperial Rome, and through
houses uninhabited for so many<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_129">[129]</span> hundreds of years. It is difficult to
describe the sensations which a scene of this kind arouses. At
first the mind is filled with sheer amazement both at the
freshness, the newness of the buildings, and at their similarity to
those in use at the present day. One cannot bring oneself to
believe that so many centuries have passed since human eyes looked
daily upon them or hands touched them. But presently a door seems
to open in the brain, a screen slides back, and clearly one sees
Time in its true relation. A thousand years, two thousand years,
have the value of the merest drop of water in an ocean. One’s hands
may reach out and touch the hands which built these houses,
fashioned these doorways, and planned these streets. This town is
not a relic of an age of miracles, when the old gods walked the
earth or sent their thunderbolts from an unremote heaven; but stone
by stone it was constructed by men in every way identical with
ourselves, whose brains have only known the sights and sounds which
we know, altered in but a few details.</p>

<p>The fact that those far-off days are so identical with those we
live in does not, however, speak to the mind of the changelessness
of things, of the constancy of human customs. That is a minor
thought. It tells rather of our misconception of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span> the nature of Time; it shows
how difficult it is to judge the ages by the standard of human
experience. In looking at these almost unharmed relics of a life
which ceased before our remotest English history had begun, one
sees that their modern appearance is not so much due to the
persistence of custom as it is to the shortness of time since the
town was built. Two thousand years is not a period which we have
the right to call long: it is but an hour in the duration of man’s
existence upon earth. “A thousand ages in thy sight are like an
evening gone,” runs the old hymn; and one feels that the ages since
this town was built must indeed be but an evening to One whose laws
of Decay and Change have not found time in them to show more than a
few signs of their working. As one entered the temple in the
twilight, and aroused unaccustomed echoes in the silence of its
halls, the thought was that one had come rudely to awaken the Past;
and, as the degenerate son of a race that had outlived its
miracles, to bring the tidings that the gods were dead. But when
the newness, the freshness of parts of the buildings, had opened
the doors of the mind, the thought was only that the gods were
still living and mighty who could think so lightly of twenty long
centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
</p>

<p>On the following morning I busied myself in taking notes and
photographs amongst the ruins; and somewhat before noon the camp
was struck. The road, now leading westwards towards Keneh, passed
for the main part of the ride along a wide valley of great beauty;
and after trotting for about three and a half hours we passed a
small ancient quarry of fine, small-grained, grey granite, near
which a few huts were grouped. Towards sunset we crossed the brow
of a hill, and so descended into the Wady Fatîreh, where we camped
near the well of that name. Here there is a Roman station differing
very slightly from those already described. It lies about five and
a half hours’ trot from Mons Claudianus, and was thus the first
night’s halting-place for express caravans on the road from that
town to Keneh.</p>

<p>As darkness fell I was sitting in the fortress questioning the
guide as to the road, when we were both startled by the sound of
falling stones, and looking up we saw a large dog-like creature
disappearing over the wall. Examining the footprints afterwards,
one saw them to be the heavy marks of a hyæna; but no more was
heard of him. Hyænas are by no means rare in the desert, though it
is not usual to find them so far back<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_132">[132]</span> from the Nile as this. In sleeping out in
the desert travellers warn one to be careful, for a hyæna, they
say, might snap at a foot protruding from the blankets, just as a
man might take a biscuit from the sideboard; but I do not recollect
hearing of anybody who has ever been attacked.</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians used to eat hyænas, and the scenes in the
early tombs show them being fattened up in the farms. Men are seen
flinging the unfortunate creatures on their backs, their legs being
tied, while others force goose-flesh down their throats. Probably
the archaic hunter in the desert ate hyæna-flesh for want of other
meat, and the custom took hold amongst the sporting families of
dynastic times; for with proper feeding there is no reason to
suppose that the meat would be objectionable. The old guide told
me, as we sat in the darkness, that there are several trappers who
make their living by snaring hyænas, and there is no part of the
animal which has not a marketable value. The skin has its obvious
uses; the skull is sold as a charm, and brings luck to any house
under the threshold of which it is buried; the fat is roasted and
eaten as a great delicacy; and the flesh is also used for eating,
and for medical purposes, certain parts being stewed down and
swallowed by women who desire to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_133">[133]</span> produce a family in spite of Nature’s
unwillingness.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Fatîreh we noticed several rough
workings in the rocks, near which there were often a few ruined
huts. These are the remains of ancient gold mines, worked by the
Egyptians and the Romans. There are said to be many old mines in
this neighbourhood, and an attempt has been made in recent years to
reopen some of them, though without much success. In an inscription
of Dynasty XVIII. (<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 1580-1350) one
reads of “the gold of the desert behind Koptos,” which city was
situated on the Nile a few miles south of Keneh; and, although most
of the Koptos metal was obtained from the region of Wady Fowakhîeh,
of which the reader will have heard in a previous chapter, some of
the gold may have been mined in the Fatîreh neighbourhood at that
date, as it certainly was in Roman times. The subject is one of
such interest that I may be permitted to mention here something of
the methods of working the gold employed by the ancient.</p>

<p>A full account is given by Diodorus, who obtained his
information from Agatharcides, of the mines which are situated in
the Eastern Desert farther to the south; and, as the methods were
no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span> doubt similar in
both districts, the information enables one to reconstruct the
scenes which these hills of Fatîreh looked down upon two thousand
years ago.</p>

<p>The persons who worked the mines were mainly criminals and
prisoners of war; but with these there were many unjustly accused
men of good breeding, and those who had by some political action
earned the Pharaoh’s or the Emperor’s wrath. Frequently this class
of prisoner was banished to the mines, together with all the
members of his family, and these also were obliged to labour for
the king’s profit. No distinctions were made at the mines between
the classes, but all suffered together, and all were weighed down
with fetters by night and by day. There was little or no chance of
escape, for sentries were posted on every hill-top, and the
soldiers were ready to give chase through the waterless desert
should a man elude the watchman. These soldiers were all of foreign
extraction, and the chances were heavy against their understanding
the speech of the prisoners; and thus they were seldom able to be
bribed or introduced into a scheme of escape.</p>

<p>The work was carried on day after day without cessation, and
always the labourers were under the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_135">[135]</span> eye of a merciless overseer, who showered
blows upon them at the slightest provocation. In order to keep down
the expenses, no clothes were provided for the prisoners, and often
they possessed not a rag to hide their nakedness. Nor were they
allowed to give a moment’s time to the bathing or care of their
bodies. In good or in bad health they were forced to work; and
neither the weakness of extreme age, nor the fever of sickness, nor
the infirmities of women, were regarded as proper cause for the
idleness even of an hour. All alike were obliged to labour, and
were urged thereto by many blows. Thus the end of a man who had
been banished to these mines was always the same: fettered and
unwashed, covered with bruises and disfigured by pestilence, he
dropped dead in his chains under the lash of the relentless whip.
The sufferings of life were such that death was hailed with joy,
and it was the dying alone who possessed a single thought of
happiness.</p>

<p>Those who have seen the old workings on the exposed face of the
rocks, and have known the coldness of the winter nights and the
intense heat of the summer days, will alone realise what tortures
these poor wretches must have suffered. One might well think that
the wind which went moaning down the valley as we rode along
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span> path to the
Nile still carried the groans of the sufferers, and that the
whispering rocks still echoed the cries of utter despair. Looking
at the huts where these people lived and the mines where they
laboured, one could not regard the record of their woe, which
Diodorus makes known to us, as a tale of long ago. Two thousand
years, one may repeat, is not really a period which we should
regard as long; and while walls stand upright and mines gape open,
the sound of lamentation will not be hushed in these valleys.</p>

<p>The rock from which the gold was obtained, says Diodorus, was
very hard; but the miners softened it by lighting fires under it,
after which it could almost be broken with the hands. When it was
thus prepared, thousands of prisoners were set to breaking it with
iron tools, while the overseer directed their labours towards the
veins of gold. To the strongest of the men iron picks were given,
and with these, though wielded unskilfully and with great labour,
they were made to attack the hillside. The galleries, following the
veins, twisted and turned, so that at the depth of a few feet there
was no glimmer of daylight; and for this reason the miners each
carried a small lamp bound to their forehead. As the blocks of
quartz were broken by the picks<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_137">[137]</span> they were carried to the surface by the
children of the captives, who formed constant procession up and
down the dark galleries. These fragments were then gathered up by
youths and placed in stone mortars, in which they were pounded with
iron pestles until the ore was broken into pieces of the size of
peas. The ore was then handed over to women and old men, who placed
it in hand-mills, and thus ground it to powder. This powder was
then placed upon a sloping surface, and a stream of water was
poured over it which carried away the particles of stone but left
the gold in position. This process of washing was repeated several
times, until all foreign matter was eliminated and the gold dust
became pure and bright. Other workmen then took the dust, and,
after measuring it carefully, they poured it into an earthenware
crucible; and having added a small quantity of lead, tin, salt, and
bran, they closed the vessel with a tight-fitting lid, and placed
it in a furnace for the space of five days. At the end of this time
the crucible was set aside to cool, and on removing the lid it was
found to contain pure gold ready to be dispatched to the
Treasury.</p>

<p>To bear witness to the accuracy of this account one sometimes
finds mortars and hand-mills lying amidst the ruins of the old
mining settlements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
At the mines of Um Garriat there are said to be thousands of these
mills, and here at Fatîreh not a few are to be found. Sluices for
washing the crushed ore have been observed in some of the old
workings; and of the smelting crucibles remnants exist at Um
Garriat and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Practically nothing is known of the methods employed by the
Egyptians in earlier days, but they cannot have differed very
greatly from those of the Roman period. There seems reason to
suppose that less cruelty existed in dynastic times than in the
days of the callous Romans; and in the following chapter an account
will be given of a temple, a well, and a town built by King Sety I.
for the benefit of the persons who were engaged in gold-mining.</p>

<p>The night spent at Fatîreh was again bitterly cold, and a
violent wind necessitated a tussle with tent-ropes and pegs: a form
of exercise as annoying in the daytime as any that exists, and in
the shivering night-time unspeakable. A couple of hours’ riding
next day brought us to the end of the mountainous country and into
the open desert. For the first time for several days the sun
streamed down from a cloudless sky, but the strong north wind
continued to blow in full force; and as we trotted over the level
plains we were half-blinded<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_139">[139]</span> by the stinging sand. The peaked hills
behind us rose from a sea of tearing sand, and before us in the
distance rose low, undulating clay mounds, beyond which one could
catch a glimpse of the limestone cliffs so typical of the Nile
valley. In the afternoon we crossed these mounds and descended into
a very maze of hillocks, amidst which we camped. Amongst these
mounds we met a couple of Bedwin, the purpose of whose presence was
entirely obscure. Our guide exchanged the usual greetings with
them, and then in a low voice began to talk of the miserable dog
which trotted dejectedly behind his camel. Again he pointed to his
almost empty bag of food, and at last dismounted, fastened a rope
to the creature’s neck, and handed it to the Bedwin. The usual
howls floated to us on the wind as we rode onwards, but the high
spirits of the guide at his freedom from any further responsibility
was a real pleasure to witness.</p>

<p>Early in the following morning I visited the Roman station of
Greiyeh, which lies some seven hours’ trot from Fatîreh, and about
six hours, or rather more, from Keneh, and was thus the first
night’s halting-place out from the Nile, or the second from Mons
Claudianus. The station is, as usual, a rectangular enclosure, in
which several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> rooms
are constructed. Particularly well preserved are the animal lines,
which lie to the west of the station. They consist of a courtyard
in which fourteen rows of stalls are built, while down either side
there has been a shed with a roof supported by a row of pillars.
Not far away is the ancient well, enclosed in a small compound.</p>

<p>This is the last of the Roman stations, and having passed it,
the ancient world seemed to slip back out of one’s reach. The
camels were set at a hard trot over the now flat and burning sand,
and by noon the distant palms of Keneh were in sight floating above
the mirage. As the houses of the town grew more and more distinct
in the dazzling sunlight, the practical concerns of one’s work came
hurrying to mind; and in times and trains, baggage and bustle, the
quiet desert, with its ghosts of Rome, faded away as fades some
wonderful dream when the sleeper wakes.</p>

<h2><a id="c6"></a>VI.<br>
THE TEMPLE OF WADY ABÂD.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> small shrine in the
Eastern Desert, which I have here called the Temple of Wady Abâd,
is known to Egyptologists as the Temple of Redesiyeh, although it
is thirty-seven miles or more from the village on the Nile, five
miles above Edfu, which bears that name. Redesiyeh seems to have
been the point from which Lepsius, the German archæologist, and
other early travellers set out to visit the desert shrine; and
hence the name of this wholly unimportant village was given to the
ruin, and nobody has bothered to find one more suitable. By the
natives the building is called <i>El Kaneis</i>, “the Chapel”; and
since it is situated in the well-known Wady Abâd, it would seem
most natural to call it the “Chapel, or Temple, of Wady Abâd.”
Modern prospectors and mining engineers have been puzzled to know
what Redesiyeh has to do with the place; and the fact that an old
German antiquarian half a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_142">[142]</span> century ago collected his camels at that
village being wholly without significance to them, they have
regarded the word Redesiyeh as a probable corruption of Rhodesia,
and have spoken, to the amazement and confusion of the uninitiate,
of the Temple of Rhodesia in the hills of the Upper Egyptian
Desert.</p>

<p>The shrine was built by King Sety I. (<span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span> 1300), the father of Rameses the Great, for the
benefit of the miners passing to and from the various gold mines
near the Red Sea; and the story one hears from the modern
engineers, which vaguely relates that the temple was erected by
King Ptolemy as a memorial to his son, who died at this spot on his
return from the mines, does not require consideration. During the
brilliant reign of Sety I. the gold mines were energetically
worked, and the produce of those upon the road to which this shrine
was built was intended especially for the upkeep and ornamentation
of the king’s great temple at Abydos, about 180 miles by river
north of the Wady Abâd. There are so many old gold workings between
the river and the Red Sea that one cannot say definitely where
Sety’s miners were bound for who stopped to offer a prayer to the
gods at this wayside shrine, but one may say certainly that Edfu,
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> old
Apollinopolis Magna, and El Kab, the old Eileithyiaspolis, were the
cities from which they set out. It will, perhaps, be best to state
that Edfu stands on the Nile about half-way between Aswan and
Luxor—<i>i.e.</i>, about 520 miles above Cairo—and that El Kab is
situated some 10 miles down-stream from Edfu. The Wady Abâd enters
the desert exactly opposite Edfu; the shrine stands about 35 miles
east of that town; and the Red Sea coast is about 100 miles farther
east as the crow flies.</p>

<p>Towards the end of March 1908, when the hot south winds were
driving the tourists towards the sea, and the trains from Luxor to
Cairo were full to overflowing, the writer and his wife set out in
the opposite direction, travelling southwards in an empty train as
far as the little wayside station of Mahamîd, the nearest
stopping-place to the ruins of El Kab. The camels which were to
carry us and our camp to Sety’s temple in the desert were awaiting
us upon the platform, surrounded by an admiring throng of native
loafers. The caravan, according to orders which were ultimately
carried out, was to consist of ten baggage and four riding camels,
and an assortment of camelmen under the leadership of a Shêkh; but
more than double that number of camels lay grunting<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> in the sunlight as the hot
train panted into the station. This was due to the fact that a
rival and more wealthy camel proprietor, who had not been invited
to do business on this occasion, had sent a few camels to the
rendezvous on the chance of their being required, and this move the
chosen proprietor met by the doubling of the number of his camels.
The disappointed owner was himself at the station, and eloquently
dilated upon the danger of trusting oneself to a Shêkh of inferior
standing. In the infallible ‘Baedeker’ one reads that for this
journey it is necessary “to secure the protection of the Shêkh of
the Ababdeh tribes”; and though the edition in which these ominous
words appear is a few years out of date, one realised in what a
dilemma a traveller who did not know the country might have found
himself. The Shêkh, it appeared, had even telegraphed his warning
to me at the last moment; but this having been really the last of a
short series of cards which it seems that he had played, it did not
require many words to soothe matters into the normal condition of
hullabaloo which everywhere prevails in Egypt at the departure of a
caravan.</p>

<p>The baggage at last being dispatched southwards, we set out
towards the ruins of El Kab, which could be seen shimmering in the
heat-haze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> a few
miles away. It was our purpose to ride to Edfu, thence into the
desert, and thence back to Edfu and on to Aswan. The first night
was to be spent under the ruined walls of the ancient city of
Eileithyiaspolis, and it did not take long to trot to the
camping-ground by the river-side. Here, in explanation of the route
which we followed, I must be permitted to enter into some
archæological details in connection with El Kab and Edfu.</p>

<p>In archaic days, when the great Hawk-chieftains who glimmer,
like pale stars, at the dawn of history were consolidating their
power in Upper Egypt before conquering the whole Nile valley, there
stood a city on the west bank of the river, opposite El Kab, which
in later times was know as Hieraconpolis, “the city of the Hawks.”
This was the earliest capital of Upper Egypt, and here it is
probable that the great king Mena, “the Fighter,” the first Pharaoh
of a united Egypt, was born and bred. This king and his father
conquered the whole of Egypt, and for that conquest a certain
amount of wealth was necessary, even in those days when might was
as good as money. For this purpose, and for the reason that the
arts of civilisation were already in practice, the gold mines of
the Eastern Desert began to be worked.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_146">[146]</span> This industry led to the establishment of a
station on the east bank of the river opposite the capital, where
the miners might foregather, and where the caravans and their
escort of soldiers might be collected.</p>

<p>As larger deeds and wider actions became the order of the
Pharaoh’s day, so the mines were extended and the number of workmen
increased; and it was not long before the station at El Kab grew
into a city almost as large as the metropolis. In Dynasty XII.
(<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2000) a wall was built around it,
which stands to this day, in order to protect it from incursions
from the desert. Gradually great temples were erected here, and the
city, now known as Nekheb and later as Eileithyiaspolis, was one of
the busiest centres in the world.</p>

<p>The ruins of the old caravanserai are of wonderful interest. One
may pass through the narrow doorway of the fortified enclosure, and
in the silent area where once the soldiers and miners camped, and
where now a few goats graze, one feels completely shut off from the
world of the present day. The dark walls rise around one almost to
their full height, and one may still ascend and descend the sloping
ramps where the sentries paced in the olden days. Here there are
the ruins of the temple<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_147">[147]</span> where the vulture-goddess was worshipped;
and yonder one sees the mounds of potsherds, bricks, corn-grinders,
and all the <i>débris</i> of a forsaken town. In the side of a hill
which overlooks the great ramparts one observes the long row of
tombs in which the princes of the district were buried; and here in
the biographical inscriptions on the walls one reads of many a feat
of arms and many a brave adventure.</p>

<p class="left sc">Pl. xxvi.</p>
</div>

<p>The hills of the desert recede in a kind of bay here, and if one
walks eastwards from the town one presently sees that there is, at
the back of the bay, an outlet through the range, five miles or so
from the river and the enclosure. It was through this natural
gateway, which the ancient Egyptians called “the Mouth of the
Wilderness,” that the caravans passed in early days into the great
desert; and once through this doorway they were immediately shut
off from the green Nile valley and all its busy life. There is a
great isolated rock which stands in the bay; and in its shadow the
miners and soldiers were wont to offer their last prayers to the
gods of Egypt, often inscribing their names upon the smooth surface
of the stone. Here one reads of priests, scribes,
caravan-conductors, soldiers, superintendents of the gold mines,
and all manner of officials, who were<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_148">[148]</span> making the desert journey, or who had come
to see its starting-point.</p>

<p>In Dynasty XVIII. Amonhotep III. (<span class="sc2">B.C.</span>
1400) erected a graceful little temple here, to which one may walk
or ride out from El Kab over the level, gravel-covered surface of
the desert, and may stand amazed at the freshness of the colouring
of the paintings on its wall. Another little shrine was built,
close by, a century and a half later; and in Ptolemaic times a
third temple was constructed. Thus one is surrounded by shrines as
one sets out over the hills away from this land of shrines: it is
as though the gods were loath to leave one, and in solemn company
came out to speed the traveller on his way.</p>

<p>The road which the gold miners trod passed through the hills,
and then turned off towards the south-east; and presently it met
the road which started from Edfu, or rather from Contra
Apollinopolis Magna, which, as has been said, is ten miles distant
from El Kab. Edfu was also a city of great antiquity, and was
famous as the place where at the dawn of Egyptian history the
Hawk-tribes overthrew the worshippers of Set, the god who
afterwards degenerated into Satan. The great temple which now
stands there, and which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_149">[149]</span> is the delight of thousands of visitors
each winter, was built upon the ruins of earlier temples where the
hawk of Edfu had been worshipped since the beginning of things. The
record of a tax levied on Edfu in the reign of Thothmes III.
(<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 1500) shows that it was mainly paid
in solid gold, instead of in kind; and one thus sees that the
precious metal was coming into the country at that time along the
Wady Abâd route, as indeed it was along all the great routes. Edfu
was the main starting-point for the mines in the days when Sety I.
built his temple, if one may judge from the fact that the hawk-god
of that city is one of the chief deities worshipped in the shrine,
while the vulture-goddess of El Kab has only a secondary place
there; and in Roman times the Edfu road was perhaps the only one in
general use.</p>

<p>This was the route which was selected for our journey; and after
spending the night at El Kab, we rode next morning along the east
bank of the river to a point at the mouth of the Wady Abâd,
opposite the picturesque town of Edfu, where the pylons shoot up to
the blue sky and dominate the cluster of brown houses and green
trees. A morning swim in the river, and a trot of somewhat over two
hours, was sufficient exercise for the first day;<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span> and the afternoon was spent in
camp, while the camelmen collected the food for the journey and led
their beasts down to the river to drink.</p>

<p>On the following morning, soon after daybreak, we mounted our
camels and set out over the hard sand and gravel towards the
sunrise. A fresh, cool wind blew from the north, and the larks were
already singing their first songs, as we trotted up the wady. The
brisk morning air, the willing camels, the setting out into the
freedom of the desert: how shall one record the charm of it? Only
those who have travelled in the desert can understand the joy of
returning there: a joy which, strangely enough, has only one equal,
and that the pleasure of returning to water, to flowers, and to
trees after a spell of some days or weeks in the wilderness. Here
there are no cares, for there are no posts nor newspapers; here
there is no fretfulness, for one is taking almost continual
exercise; here there is no irritation, for man, the arch-irritant,
is absent; here there is no debility and fag, for one is drinking
in renewed strength from the strong conditions around. But ever
enthusiasm, that splendid jewel in the ring of life, shines and
glitters before one’s eyes; and all one’s actions assume a broader
and a happier complexion.<span class="pagenum" id=

world, and therein one truly breathes and lives.</p>

<p>A trot of about two hours brought us to the well known as Bir
Abâd. The well is but a small, stagnant pool of brackish water,
around which a few trees grow. There are six acacias, three or four
small palms, a curious dead-looking tree called <i>Heraz</i> by the
natives, and a few desert shrubs. Some attempt has been made to
cultivate a small area, but this has not met with success, and the
native farmers have departed. The sand under the acacias offers a
welcome resting-place, and here in the shade we sat for a while,
listening to the quiet shuffle of the wind amongst the trees and to
the singing of the sand-martins. While playing idly with the sand
an objectionable insect was uncovered, which the natives call a
“ground-gazelle.” It is a fat, maggot-like creature, about an inch
in length, possessing a pair of nippers similar to those of an
earwig. It runs fast upon its six or eight legs, but, whenever
possible, it buries itself by wriggling backwards into the sand. A
more loathsome insect could not well be imagined; and, since the
species is said to be by no means uncommon, one will not delve with
the fingers so readily in the future as one lies in the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span> shadow of the trees. A ride of
about half an hour’s duration along the valley and past a Shêkh’s
tomb, known as Abu Gehâd, brought us to the ruined Roman fortified
station named after this tomb. It is much like other stations of
this date, and consists of an enclosure in which a few chambers are
to be seen. One enters from the west, and in the open area forming
the courtyard there is a cemented tank in which a supply of water
was stored for the use of travellers. The south wall of the
enclosure to this day looks formidable from the outside, still
standing some twelve feet in height, and being solidly built of
broken stones. On this side of the station there are traces of an
outbuilding, which may have been the animal lines. In the main
enclosure a block of sandstone was found bearing the cartouches of
the Pharaoh Tutankhamen (<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 1350), one
of the successors of the “heretic king” Akhnaton, and by its form
it seems to have been part of a shrine which perhaps had stood at
this spot. The road from El Kab here joins the Edfu route, and the
Pharaoh may have marked the meeting of the ways by a little wayside
temple at which the gold miners might offer a prayer to the gods of
the wilderness.</p>

<p>In Roman days when this station was built it is probable that
the gold mines no longer formed the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_153">[153]</span> main objective of the caravans which passed
along this road. Emeralds, almost unknown to the ancient Egyptians,
were now deemed an ornamentation of worth and beauty; and the
emerald mines of Gebel Zabâra, which are most easily approached
along this route, were vigorously worked by the Romans. It was on
his way to these mines that Cailliaud in 1816 discovered the temple
of Sety I. There was also a road from Edfu to the Græco-Roman port
of Berenice on the Red Sea, which was much used at this period; and
stations similar to that of Abu Gehâd are to be met with at fairly
regular intervals for the whole distance to the coast.</p>

<p>Trotting on for another two hours and a quarter, we camped under
the rocks of the Gebel Timsah, a well-known landmark to travellers.
A head of rock projects into the level valley, and upon it the
people of the desert for untold generations have set up small heaps
of stones, the original idea of which must have been connected with
religious worship. The two tents were no sooner pitched than a gale
of wind, suddenly rising, tore one of them down, and almost
succeeded in overthrowing the other. A tempest of dust and sand
beat in at the doorway, and covered all things with a brown layer,
so that one knew not where to turn nor<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_154">[154]</span> how to escape. Fortunately, however, like
all things violent, it did not last for long; and a calm, starlit
night followed.</p>

<p>The distance from Gebel Timsah to the temple which was our
destination may be covered in about an hour and a half of trotting.
We set out soon after sunrise; and presently a low ridge was
crossed, the path passing between two piles or beacons of stones,
set up perhaps in Roman days to mark the road; and from this point
a wide, flat valley could be seen, stretching between the low
hills, and much overgrown with bushes and brambles. Over the plain
we jogged in the cool morning air, directing the camels to a high
bluff of rock in the east, in which, the guide told us, the temple
of Sety was excavated. Soon a Roman fortress came into sight, and
later we were able to discern the portico of the temple sheltering
under the rocks. Slowly the features became more distinct, and at
last we dismounted at the foot of the cliffs and scrambled up the
slope to explore the picturesque shrine.</p>

<p>It is strange that of the many Egyptologists who have travelled
in Egypt, only two, Lepsius and Golénischeff, have visited this
spot. It may be that the statement of the old Baedeker, which says
that the wandering Ababdeh tribes “assume<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_155">[155]</span> a hostile attitude” to travellers, has
confined them to the banks of the Nile; or perhaps the reported
antics of the much-maligned camel have induced them to leave
unvisited this pearl of the past. For that matter, however, the
place might be reached upon the back of the patient ass, there
being water at Bir Abâd, and, for the last few years, at the temple
itself. When one sees this building, one of the best preserved of
all the Egyptian temples, one is amazed at the lack of enterprise
which has caused it to be uncared for, unprotected, and unvisited
for all these years. A few mining engineers and prospectors alone
have seen the shrine; and, since they have disfigured its walls
with their names, one could wish that they too had stayed at
home.</p>

<p>The little temple consists of a rectangular hall excavated in
the rock, the roof being supposed to be supported by four square
pillars, though in reality these also are part of the living rock.
At the far end there are three shrines in which the statues of the
gods are carved. In front of this hall there is a built portico,
the roof of which rests upon four columns with lotus-bud capitals.
One enters from the north, up the slope of fallen stones and driven
sand, and so passes into the shade of the portico.
Through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> a hole in
the roof, where a slab of stone has fallen in, one may look up at
the towering rocks which overhang the building. Then, through a
beautifully ornamented doorway, one passes into the dimness of the
rock-cut hall, where one may be conscious that the whole height of
the hill rests above one’s head. Both this hall and the portico are
richly decorated with coloured reliefs, and in the inner portions
of the temple one stands in wonder at the brightness of the colours
in the scenes which are seen on all sides. It has been said that
the brilliancy of the painting in the temple of Amonhotep III. at
El Kab is surprising; but here it is still fresher, and has even
more admirably held its own against the assaults of time. We see
the Pharaoh smiting down his negro and Asiatic enemies in the
presence of Amen Ra and Horus of Edfu; we watch him as he makes
offerings to the gods; and to the ceiling the eye is attracted by
the great vultures with spread wings which there hover above one,
depicted in radiant colours rendered more radiant by contrast with
the browns and the yellows of the scenery outside. In the niches at
the end of the hall the gods sit in serenity; and, though these
figures have been damaged almost beyond recognition by pious
Musslemans, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
still clings around them their old majesty, and still one may find
something solemn in their attitude, so that one almost pays heed to
the warning inscribed on the doorway that a man must be twice
purified before entering the little sanctuary where they sit.</p>

<p>It may be asked why Sety selected this spot for his temple, for,
except that it lies on the route to the mines, the reason for its
location is not at once apparent. The explanation, however, is not
far to seek. This great bluff of rock has a smooth cliff-like
surface on its north side, and for the earliest travellers, as for
those of the present day, it has cast a welcome shadow in which one
might take the midday siesta in comfort. Here, scratched or
chiselled on the rock, there are very many drawings which
undoubtedly date from archaic, and even prehistoric, times.
Numerous representations of curious boats are seen, and their
character justifies one in supposing them to be the sacred arks
which formed in ancient times such an essential part of Egyptian
religious ceremonial. In most of these vessels one sees the shrine
which contained the god, and in one drawing a figure with flail
raised, before which an animal is being sacrificed, is certainly
the god Min himself, the patron of the desert. A few animals and
figures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> are also
drawn, and when human beings are represented in or near the arks
their arms are shown held aloft in the regular Egyptian attitude of
worship.</p>

<p>Thus it seems that, from being a place to rest and to dream in,
the rock had already in archaic times become a sacred spot, at
which early man bowed himself down before the representations of
the ark of Min. From this period until Dynasty XVIII. it seems,
from the lack of inscriptions here, that the mines were not much
used. Amonhotep III., however, sent his Viceroy of the South out
here, whose name, Merimes, is written upon the rocks near the
temple; and his temple at El Kab, at the beginning of the route, is
a further indication of his interest in the gold workings. Just as
this king had built his temple near the sacred rock at “the Mouth
of the Wilderness,” so Sety I., following half a century later,
decided to erect his shrine at the foot of this more distant sacred
rock, the half distance having been already adventured by the
intermediate Pharaoh Tutankhamen. Since the place was just about a
day’s express ride from Edfu and El Kab, its situation was
convenient; and, moreover, there was no other head of rock in the
neighbourhood which offered so fine a position for a rock
temple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
</p>

<p>In the inscriptions near the mouth of the excavated portion of
the shrine, Sety caused to be recorded the story of the building of
the temple; and parts of this are of sufficient interest to be
quoted here:—</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>In the year 9 (<span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 1304), the third
month of the third season, the twentieth day. Lo! his majesty
inspected the hill-country as far as the region of the mountains,
for his heart desired to see the mines from which the gold is
brought. Now when his majesty had gone out from the Nile valley, he
made a halt on the road, in order to take counsel with his heart;
and he said, “How evil is the way without water! It is so for a
traveller whose mouth is parched. How shall his throat be cooled,
how shall he quench his thirst?—for the lowland is far away, and
the highland is vast. The thirsty man cries out to himself against
a fatal country. Make haste!—let me take counsel of their needs. I
will make for them a supply for preserving them alive, so that they
will thank God in my name in after years.” Now, after his majesty
had spoken these words in his own heart, he coursed through the
desert seeking a place to make a water-station; and lo! the god led
him in order to grant the request which he desired. Then were
commanded quarrymen to dig a well upon the desert, that he might
sustain the fainting, and cool for him the burning heat of summer.
Then this place was built in the great name of Sety, and the water
flowed into it in very great plenty. Said his majesty, “Behold, the
god has granted my petition, and he has brought to me water upon
the desert. Since the days of the gods the way has been dangerous,
but it has been made pleasant in my glorious reign. Another good
thought has come into my heart, at<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_160">[160]</span> command of the god, even the equipment of a
town, in whose midst shall be a settlement with a temple. I will
build a resting-place on this spot, in the great name of my fathers
the gods. May they grant that what I have wrought shall abide, and
that my memory shall prosper, circulating through the
hill-country.”</p>

<p>Then his majesty commanded that the leader of the King’s workmen
be commissioned, and with him the quarrymen, that there should be
made, by excavation in the mountain, this temple. Now after the
stronghold was completed and adorned, and its paintings executed,
his majesty came to worship his fathers, all the gods; and he said,
“Praise to you, O great gods! May ye favour me forever, may ye
establish my name eternally. As I have been useful to you, as I
have been watchful for the things which ye desire, may ye speak to
those who are still to come, whether kings, princes, or people,
that they may establish for me my work in this place, on behalf of
my beautiful temple in Abydos.”</p>
</div>

<p>The last words tell us for what purpose this route to the gold
mines had been bettered. A second long inscription is devoted to
blessings on those who keep up this shrine and the mines with which
it was connected, and to curses on those who allow it to fall into
neglect. A third inscription is supposed to give the speech of the
travellers who have benefited by the king’s thoughtfulness:—</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>Never was the like of it (the temple and the well) made by any
king, save by the King Sety, the good shepherd,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> who preserves his soldiers
alive, the father and mother of all. Men say from mouth to mouth,
“O Amen, give to him eternity, double to him everlastingness; for
he has opened for us the road to march on, when it was closed
before us. We proceed and are safe, we arrive and are preserved
alive. The difficult way which is in our memory has become a good
way. He has caused the mining of the gold to be easy. He hath dug
for water in the desert far from men for the supply of every
traveller who traverses the highlands.”</p>
</div>

<p>Sety dedicated his temple to Amen Ra, whom he identified with
Min, the old god of the place, and to Harmachis, the sun-god, whom
he seems to have identified with the hawk, Horus of Edfu. He also
here worshipped Ptah, the Egyptian Vulcan, and his lion-headed
consort Sekhmet; Tum; Hathor, the Egyptian Venus; Nekheb, the
vulture-goddess of El Kab; Osiris and Isis; Mut, the mother
goddess; and Khonsu, the moon-god who was the son of Amen Ra and
Mut, and with them formed the royal trinity at Thebes. All these
gods one sees upon the walls of the temple, and before them Sety is
shown offering incense, wine, flowers, and food. Some inscriptions
on the rocks near the temple, written by high officials of this
period who visited the mines, make mention of two other deities:
Ra, the sun-god, and a strange goddess who rides a horse and
brandishes a shield and spear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
</p>

<p>When Sety died the temple was still not quite finished, and for
some reason or other which we shall probably never know, it so
remained. His temple at Abydos, too, was neglected, and the
revenues ceased to be collected. Thus, in spite of the curses
inscribed on the walls of the desert shrine, the king’s plans for
the continual working of the mines, in order to pay for the
maintenance of his great masterpiece, were not carried out. At
Abydos Rameses II., in an inscription written a few years later,
states that he found the temple of Sety there unfinished, and that
it had not been “completed according to the regulations for it of
the gold-house.” He, however, finished the building, and perhaps
re-established the gold workings along the Wady Abâd route, for on
one of the pillars of the hall of the desert shrine there is an
inscription written by an official which reads: “Bringing the gold
for the festival in the temple of Rameses II.”</p>

<p>Since that time until the present day the gods in the sanctuary
have looked out at a long stream of travellers, soldiers, miners,
and officials. Upon the rocks and on the walls of the temple there
are several hieroglyphical and Greek inscriptions which tell of the
coming of all manner of people. A chief of the custodians of El Kab
here records his name,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_163">[163]</span> and a scribe of the king’s troops is
immortalised near by. Many of the Greek inscriptions are ex-votos
dedicated to Pan, with whom the old Min had been identified; and as
the latter was the god of desert travel, so the sprightly Pan
becomes the sober patron of the roads. Miners from Syracuse and
from Crete tell of their advent; and one traveller describes
himself as an Indian, a voyager, perhaps, in one of those trading
vessels which brought to the port of Berenice the riches of the
East, to be conveyed across this great desert to the markets of
Alexandria. A man named Doriōn states that he had returned in
safety from an elephant hunt, probably in the south. Two
inscriptions are written by Jews, thanking God for their safe
journeys; and it is interesting to notice that one of them is
called Theodotus, son of Doriōn, and the other Ptolemy, son of
Dionysius—all pagan names. A troop of Greek soldiers have recorded
their names in the temple, and state that they kept a watch before
“Pan of the Good Roads.”</p>

<p>These travellers, besides, or instead of, writing their names,
seem often to have piled a few stones at conspicuous points as a
memorial of their passage. At various places in the neighbourhood,
and especially at the foot of the hills opposite<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> the temple, there are many
such piles of stones; and when well built they rise from the rocks
like altars, three feet or so in height, and perhaps two feet in
diameter. In one or two cases there are fragments of old Egyptian
pottery lying beside them, and there seems no question that they
are connected with religious worship. The same custom still
prevails amongst the desert people, though now its significance is
not remembered; and yet its meaning is not entirely forgotten, for
on a hill-top near the temple we found, near such a pile of stones,
three pairs of gazelle horns and a collection of Red Sea shells
pierced for stringing, a modern offering to the old gods.</p>

<p>In Græco-Roman times a large fortified station was constructed
near the temple, and this still stands in fairly good preservation.
It is built in the plain in front of the temple, not more than a
hundred yards from the foot of the cliffs. The enclosure is
somewhat larger than is usual in these stations, but the greater
part of the area has never been built upon. The enclosing wall
still stands to a height of ten feet or so in parts, but here and
there it is almost entirely ruined. It is built in three
thicknesses, so that on the inside there are two heights at which
one might walk around the rampart without showing above it. One
enters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span> through a
well-built masonry doorway, and on either side one may see the hole
into which the beam was shot to close the wooden door at nights. On
one’s right there is a group of small chambers; and here an
isolated house, in one wall of which a window is still intact,
forms the best-preserved portion of the ruin. On one’s left there
is a large hall, in which there was a tank, parts of which, now
half-choked with sand, can be seen. The next building on one’s left
is also a hall of considerable size—the common mess-room, probably,
of the travellers. One then passes into the open courtyard, which
bears off to the left, or north, and does not contain more than a
trace or so of walls.</p>

<p>Although one sees so many of these Roman stations in the Eastern
Desert, their charm and interest never palls; and, more than any
other ancient buildings, they bring back the lost ages and recall
the forgotten activities of the old world. These ruins, too, are
always picturesque, and gather to themselves at dawn and at sunset
the hues, the lights, and the shadows of the fairest fancy. At
dawn, at noon, at sunset—all day long—this fortress in the Wady
Abâd is beautiful; and for those who love the desert there is here
and in its surroundings always some new thing to charm. The walls
of the enclosure, and beyond them the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_166">[166]</span> pillared portico of the temple sheltering
under the rugged brown cliffs, form as delightful a picture as may
be found in Egypt. As one sits in the blue shadow one may watch the
black-and-white stone-chats fluttering from rock to rock, and
overhead there circles a vulture, as vividly coloured as those
which form the ceiling decoration in the temple. The wide flat
plain, shut in by the distant hills on all sides, entices one from
the fortress on to its sparkling surface, though the tumbled rocks
near the temple soon call one back to their breezy humps and shady
nooks. The hundred surrounding hill-tops vie with one another in
the advertisement of their merits, and one attains a summit but to
covet a further prospect. Or, attracted by the two or three trees
and the few bushes which grow in the plain over against the
fortress, one walks to their welcoming shade; and there one may
listen to the song of the sand-martins and to the strange,
long-drawn note of the finches.</p>

<p>One knows now what the old philosopher desired to express; for
the wilderness is indeed Paradise, and here one may find the true
happiness.</p>

<p>The day slips past in a half-dream of pleasure, and to the
student of archæology, who finds so<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_167">[167]</span> much for his pencil to record and his mind
to consider, the hours race by at an absurd speed. The two days
which we spent here passed like an afternoon’s dream, and the
memories which remain in the mind are almost too slight to record.
Writing here in the study one reconstructs the rugged scene, and
searches for the incidents which gave gentle colour to it. There
was a flight of cranes, which sailed overhead, moving from
south-east to north-west, on their way to spend the summer in
Europe. Why should one’s memory recall so charmedly the passage of
a hundred birds? There was a hyæna which, in the red dusk, stood
upon a hill-top to watch us, and presently disappeared. There were
three vultures which rose from the bones of a dead camel, soared
into the sky, and alighted again when we had passed. There came a
flock of goats and sheep at noonday to the well, with much bleating
and with the gentle patter of many hoofs. The shepherd in his
picturesque rags eyed us curiously as his charges drank, and, still
watching us, passed down the wady towards the west when they had
quenched their thirst. And so one’s memory wanders over the two
days, recalling the trivialities, and passing over the more precise
details of camp life and of work, until presently one sees the tent
struck and the baggage<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_168">[168]</span> bumping down the valley once more on the
backs of the grunting camels. The return journey to Edfu was soon
accomplished, and the accumulated mail of five or six days which
was in waiting at the end of the ride quickly brought one back to
the business of life, and relegated the Wady Abâd to the
store-chamber of happy recollections.</p>

<h2><a id="c7"></a>VII.<br>
A NUBIAN HIGHWAY.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Opposite</span> the town of Aswân,
a short distance below the First Cataract of the Nile, there rises
an island known to travellers by its Greek name of Elephantine. The
river sweeps down from the cataract to east and west; southwards
one may watch it flowing around a dozen dark clumps of granite
rocks, which thrust themselves, as it were, breathless above the
water; and northwards almost without hindrance it passes between
the hills and palm-trees of the mainland. Nowadays should one stand
upon the mounds which mark the site of the ancient city of
Elephantine, and look east and north, one would feel that modern
civilisation had hidden for ever the scenes of the past, and had
prevented the imagination from re-picturing the place as it was in
the elder days. The huge Cataract Hotel overshadows the ruined
city, and stares down from its pinnacle of granite on to the
tumbled stones of ancient temples. On the island<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> itself, opposite this hotel,
the elaborate and ultramodern rest-house of the Ministry of Public
Works rises amidst its terraced gardens; and farther to the north
stands the imposing Savoy Hotel, surrounded by luxuriant trees and
flowers unknown to the ancient Egyptians. Eastwards the long, neat
promenade of Aswân edges the river, backed by the Grand Hotel, the
Government offices, and other large buildings; and at one end the
noisy railway station tells the insistent tale of the Present.
During the winter one may watch the busy launches and small craft
plying to and fro, and may see the quality and fashion of Europe
amusing itself at either end of the passage; while at night the
brilliant lights blaze into the waters of the Nile from a thousand
electric lamps, and the sounds of the latest valse drift out
through open windows. The place is modern: one sips one’s
whisky-and-soda above the crushed-down remains of Pharaonic
splendours, plays tennis in a garden laid out above the libraries
of the Ptolemies, and reads ‘The Times’ where, maybe, melancholy
Juvenal wrote his Fifteenth Satire.</p>

<p>But should one turn now to the west and south a different
impression might be obtained. On the island still stands the
imposing gateway of the rich temple destroyed for the sake of its
building-stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> in
the days of Muhammed Ali; and near it, only recently, an
archæologist uncovered the intact burial vault of the sacred rams
of the Nile-god Khnum. The rocky hills of the western mainland
tower above the island, great drifts of golden sand carrying the
eye from the summit to the water’s edge; and here, cut into the
rocks, are the tombs of the ancient princes of Elephantine. In this
direction there is almost nothing that is more modern than the
ruined monastery of St Simeon, built at the head of a sandy valley
in the early days of Christianity, and destroyed by the fierce
brother of Saladin in 1173 <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> With one’s
back to the hotels, and one’s face to these changeless hills, the
history of the old city is able to be traced with something of the
feeling of reality to aid the thoughts.</p>

<p>One period of that history stands out clearly and distinctly
amidst the dim course of far-off events. From being a stronghold of
a savage tribe the south end of the island had become covered by
the houses and streets of a fine city, named <i>Abu</i> or
“Elephant-City” (and hence Elephantine), no doubt after the
elephant symbol of its chieftain. The feudal tendencies of the Vth
and VIth Dynasties—about <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2750 to
2475—had brought power and wealth to the local princes<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> in many parts of Egypt; and
here the family of the chieftains of the island had begun to rise
to a degree of some importance. This was largely due to the fact
that to them was intrusted the office of “Keeper of the Door of the
South,” and the protecting of the Egyptian frontier at the First
Cataract from invasion by the negro tribes beyond.</p>

<p>The city rose amidst its trees and rocks at the foot of the
cataract, at a point where in those days the river still ran swift,
and where the distant roar of waters continuously drummed upon the
ears. On the eastern mainland opposite the island stood the huts
and hovels of the great <i>’Swanu</i>, or market, which gave its
name to the latter town of Aswân; and here the negroes, coming from
the upper reaches of the river by the valley road which avoids the
rocks of the cataract, met and traded with the inhabitants of
Elephantine. At the far end of this road the barren islands of
Philæ, Bigeh, and others were regarded as neutral ground, and the
rocks of the mainland were not yet forbidden territory to the
Egyptians for some miles up-stream. But beyond this the country was
little known, and those who penetrated into it took their lives in
their hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
</p>

<p>First there came the land of the Kau tribes; and then, farther
to the south, the Wawat on the east bank and the Sethu on the west
dwelt in barbaric independence. Still farther to the south lived
the warlike Mazoi, who might sometimes be seen at the market,
ostrich feathers in their hair and bows and clubs in their hands.
The land of Arthet lay to the south again; and lastly, not much
below the Second Cataract and the modern Wady Hâlfa, there lived
the almost unknown people of Aam.</p>

<p>Who dwelt to the south of this the Egyptians did not know. That
territory was “The Land of the Ghosts”: the perilous borders of the
world, and the misty ocean into which no man had penetrated, were
there to be encountered. To the inhabitants of the brilliant little
metropolis the peoples of the upper river appeared to be a hazy
folk; and the farther south their land the more mysterious were
their surroundings and the ghostlier their ways. The negroes who
came to the market no doubt told stories then, as they did in later
times, of the great stature and the marvellous longevity of those
distant races; and though but a couple of hundred miles of winding
river separated the Egyptian frontier from that<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> of the land of Aam, that
distance sufficed to twist the thoughts of the market-gossiper from
the mortal to the immortal.</p>

<p>In archaic times an unknown Egyptian king had penetrated some
sixty miles up the river, and had left a record on one of the
rocks;<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> and King Sneferu of the IIIrd Dynasty had
devastated a part of the country. But from that time until the
beginning of the Vth Dynasty the land and its people, left
unmolested, had drifted once more into the pale regions of mystery.
As the nobles of Elephantine grew in wealth and power, however,
their attention began to be turned with some degree of fixidity
towards the south; and when the energetic King Sahura came to the
throne, it was felt that the time had arrived for the probing of
the mystery.</p>

<p>The roads which led to the south along the eastern bank of the
river, and which were used by the negroes near the frontier when
coming to the market, were not practicable for caravans bound for
distant goals; and the Egyptians<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_175">[175]</span> turned their eyes, therefore, to the
western hills, behind which the sorrowful lands of the Dead were
somewhere situated. Almost exactly opposite the city lay a
sand-covered valley, in which now stands the ruined monastery
mentioned above. From the island a boat carried one across to the
little reedy bay, from whence a trudge of half a mile or so over
the soft sand brought one on to the upper levels of the desert.
Looking towards the north, the road which led eventually to Lower
Egypt was to be seen; to the west the eye wandered over the
undulating wilderness to the far horizon, made awful by the
presence of the Dead; and to the south the sand-drifts and the
rocky hillocks hid the untravelled paths to Aam and the Land of the
Ghosts. Keeping the river on the left hand, it seemed to the
Egyptians that they might here pass over the upper desert as far as
the gods permitted men to penetrate; and a descent to the Nile at
any convenient point would bring them, like a bolt from heaven,
upon the tribes there settled.</p>

</div>

<p>The army of Sahura—perhaps a thousand men with numerous
baggage-donkeys—set out along this road, and after a march of a few
days as nearly straight ahead as possible, struck the river (which
bends towards the west) at a point in the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_176">[176]</span> land of Arthet, now known as Tomâs. A
tribute was no doubt collected from the rich fields which there
border the Nile; an inscription recording the name of one of the
captains was cut upon a convenient face of rock; and the army
returned to Egypt to publish its heroism in the streets of
Elephantine. Another expedition in the reign of King Asesa followed
after a few years, the event being again recorded on the rocks.
Farther than Arthet, however, these armed forces did not venture to
go; nor was this Nubian highroad used with great frequency during
the following years.</p>

<p>About the year 2500 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> a prince of
Elephantine named Herkhuf made up his mind to penetrate farther
towards the mysterious lands of the south. It is forty-four
centuries since he set out over the desert, with the wind whistling
past his ears and the powerful sun warming his bones and his heart
within him; yet the story of his adventures may still be read, the
path by which he travelled may still be discerned, and the names of
his captains may still be seen on the rocks of the land of Arthet.
Herkhuf, having obtained the necessary order from the Pharaoh, set
out with his father Ara, “in order,” as he says, “to explore a road
to the country of Aam.” The road which he explored<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> and opened up was probably a
continuation of the route from Elephantine to Arthet, passing not
far back from the river, and descending to the water between Abu
Simbel and Wady Hâlfa in the heart of the land of Aam. The
expedition was entirely successful, and Herkhuf states that he was
“very greatly praised for it.” Emboldened by the fame which his
enterprise had brought him, he made a second expedition to Aam, and
was gone from Egypt eight months. A third excursion was more
adventurous. Herkhuf set out upon the “Oasis-road,” which runs from
a point north of Aswân to Kurkur Oasis, and thence branches to
Tomâs or Arthet and to the Oasis of Khârgeh which lies westward,
and which in those days was inhabited by Libyan tribes. At the
Kurkur junction Herkhuf met with an army, under the leadership of
the Prince of Aam, which was on its way to chastise these Libyans;
but how the wily Egyptian contrived to use it instead as an escort
to his own men back to Aam, and how he returned to Egypt through
the hostile territory of Sethu, Arthet, and Wawat, with three
hundred asses laden with the presents of his host, are tales too
long to narrate here.</p>

<p>One story only may be recorded in this chapter. During a fourth
expedition to Aam, Herkhuf had<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_178">[178]</span> managed to obtain one of the dwarfs or
pigmies who inhabited a region of the Land of the Ghosts. He at
once informed the king, now the boy Pepy II.; and in reply he
received the following letter, which is, perhaps, the earliest
example in the world’s history of a private communication:—</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>“I have noted,” writes the King, “the matter of your letter
which you have sent to me, in order that I might know that you have
returned in safety from Aam, with the army which was with you. . .
. You say in your letter that you have brought a dancing pigmy of
the god from the Land of the Ghosts, like the pigmy which the
Treasurer Baurded brought from the Land of Pount in the time of
Asesa. You say to my majesty, ‘Never before has one like him been
brought by any one who has visited Aam.’ . . . Come northward,
therefore, to the court immediately, and bring this pigmy with you,
which you must bring living, prosperous, and healthy, from the Land
of the Ghosts, to dance for the King and to rejoice and gladden the
heart of the King. When he goes down with you into the vessel,
appoint trustworthy people to be beside him at either side of the
vessel: take care that he does not fall into the water. When he
sleeps at night, appoint trustworthy people who shall sleep beside
him in his cabin; and make an inspection ten times each night. My
majesty desires to see this pigmy more than the gifts of Sinai and
of Pount. If you arrive at court, the pigmy being with you, alive,
prosperous, and healthy, my majesty will do for you a greater thing
than that which was done for the Treasurer Baurded in the time of
Asesa, according to the heart’s desire of my majesty to<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> see this pigmy. Orders have
been sent to the chief of the New Towns to arrange that food shall
be taken from every store-city and every temple (on the road)
without stinting.”</p>
</div>

<p>How easy it is to picture the excited boy awaiting the arrival
of this wonder from the south, or to watch in the imagination the
long caravan as it winds its way over the western hills from Aam to
Elephantine, where Herkhuf and his prize will take ship to
Memphis.</p>

<p>Later in the reign of Pepy II. the tribes of Arthet and Wawat
revolted, and the Nubian highroad echoed with the songs of Egyptian
soldiers. The commander of the expedition, named Pepynakht, slew a
large number of the unfortunate negroes, took many prisoners, and
collected a great quantity of plunder. It was perhaps during this
disturbance that a certain prince of Elephantine, named Mekhu, was
murdered in Arthet. News of his death was brought to his son Sabna
by a ship’s captain who had himself escaped. Sabna immediately
collected a few soldiers and a hundred baggage-donkeys, bearing
presents of honey, oil, ointment, and fine linen, and set out upon
the same highroad towards Arthet. By the judicious use of his oil
and honey he was able to discover the body of his father; and,
loading it upon a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
donkey, he commenced the return journey. Before he was clear of
Arthet, however, he found it necessary to avert an attack by
presenting a sullen negro chieftain with an elephant’s tusk three
cubits in length, at the same time hinting that his best tusk was
six cubits in length. But how the expedition arrived safely at
Elephantine, and how Sabna buried his father there in the western
hills behind the modern Savoy Hotel, and how he was rewarded by the
king for his really plucky undertaking, cannot be here related at
length.</p>

<p>There was now no more mystery about the country on this side of
the Second Cataract, and by the perseverance of these princes of
Elephantine the way was made ready for the conquest of the Sudân,
which the Egyptians commenced in the XIIth Dynasty and completed in
the XVIIIth. We of the present day cannot, perhaps, appreciate how
much pluck and obstinacy these nobles required in the undertaking
of these expeditions. Not only were they penetrating into lands
which were inhabited by the most savage tribes, but they believed
these tribes to be endowed with superhuman powers. From childhood
they had heard stories of their magical power; while in pushing
their way into the distant land of Aam they<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_181">[181]</span> assuredly expected to encounter those
ghosts who hovered at the edge of the world. Their caravan routes
over the western hills ran dangerously near the terrible territory
of the Dead; and, to their superstitious minds, their daily marches
and their nightly camps were beset by monsters and by bogies
compared to which the fierce Mazoi were as nought.</p>

<p>The reader who finds interest in the picture of Herkhuf
exploring the roads of Aam, and of Sabna searching for his father’s
body in hostile Arthet, will ask whether any definite traces of the
highroad still remain. One would have thought that after four
thousand four hundred years it would have utterly disappeared; but
this is not the case. Let the visitor to Aswân step out some
afternoon from the hall of his hotel, where the string band throbs
in his ears and the latest Parisian gowns shimmer before his eyes,
and let him take boat to the little western bay behind the ruins of
Elephantine. Here in the late afternoon the long blue shadows fall,
and he may walk in coolness over the sand towards the monastery
which stands on the higher ground before him. At the top of the
hills to his left he will presently see, some distance away, a
large isolated boulder near the tomb of some old Mussleman saint;
and making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span> his way
up the hillside towards this boulder, he will suddenly come upon a
paved causeway<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a> which sweeps up over the sand to the rocky
summit. Rough flat blocks of sandstone form the paving, and these
are only here and there overwhelmed by the drifting sand, though it
is evident that the road has been entirely buried at the point
where it approaches the water.</p>

<p>Mounting to the hill-top, the causeway is seen to pass within a
few yards of the great boulder which one now finds to have been
surrounded by a rough wall, as though to form a kind of sanctuary
or chapel. On the sides of the rock there are several inscriptions
recording the coming of various officials of the
Empire—tax-collectors, superintendents of the Nubian gold mines,
and so on. It is evident from this that the road was used for many
a long year after Herkhuf and Sabna had done with it; though now it
possessed for the travellers no terrors, nor did it lead any more
to the Land of the Ghosts.</p>

<p>At the point where the causeway passes the boulder the hard
surface of the upper desert literally bristles with countless
little heaps of stones, each consisting of a small, upright
slab<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span> of rock, held
in place by two or three others. Fragments of pottery indicate that
a bowl, perhaps containing water, had been placed beside each pile.
Here, then, are the memorials of the travellers who set out for
distant Arthet from the fair city on the island, which may from
here be seen floating in the blue waters of the Nile below. These
stones are the prayers of those who asked a prosperous journey from
the gods of their city: from the old ram-headed Khnum who lived in
the dark caverns below the Nile; from Satet, the horned goddess
whose bow and arrows were the terror of her enemies; and from
Anuket with the crown of lofty feathers. For a short distance one
may follow the paved road now, as it passes southwards and
westwards amidst the blackened rocks and golden sand-drifts of this
lifeless land; but presently it tops a deeply shadowed ridge of
rock and sand, and so descends into, and is lost amidst, the wide,
undulating desert, ablaze with the light of the setting sun.</p>

<p>There are not many persons who will find themselves able to
follow the road by camel, as I did, or to take ship up the Nile, to
Arthet, in order to see the terminus of the first part of the
highway. The road descends to the river behind the rich fields of
the straggling village of Tomâs, near Derr,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_184">[184]</span> the present capital of Lower Nubia. The
scenery here is beautiful in the extreme. A short distance
down-stream a bluff of rock, projecting to the water’s edge, and
half-covered with drift-sand, marks the probable boundary between
Arthet and Sethu. One might slide here from the top of the bluff
down the golden slopes to the verdant thornbushes which dip towards
the river, and from either side of the track one’s figure would be
seen sharply against the deep blue of the sky. Sliding, one would
see on the left the rocks and the sand of Sethu, and distantly the
superb array of the mountains of Wawat; while on the right the
green bay into which the road descended would lie spread as a feast
to the eye. Farther up-stream a wooded island lies in the Nile,
whither the inhabitants must often have fled at the approach of the
Egyptians from the desert.</p>

<p>On the low cliffs which form the backing of this bay many a
captain of an expedition or master of a caravan has written his
name, and sometimes a date has been added. “The Superintendent of
all the caravan-conductors of the Land of the South: Sabna”; “the
Captain of the Soldiers: Akab”; “the Captain of the ships of Asesa:
Khnumhotep”; “the sixth year: written by the Captain of the
soldiers . . .”; these are examples of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_185">[185]</span> inscriptions which were here cut into the
surface of the rock, and which to the archæologist are of the first
importance. A caravan-conductor named Ara, who is probably to be
identified with the father of Herkhuf, has left his name here; and
more than one Sabna occurs. But perhaps the most interesting of
these records are three short inscriptions which tell of an
expedition to Arthet under the almost unknown Pharaoh Hornefersa,
who probably reigned about <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 2400. It
is in one of these inscriptions that the name of this
country—Arthet—is given, thereby making it possible definitely to
locate the territory of these people, and to identify this highway
without any further question with the “Elephantine road” referred
to in the inscriptions as leading from Elephantine to Arthet.</p>

<p>Above these rocks one steps on to the hard surface of the
desert, and the eye may travel over the broken ground to the north
for many a mile, and may follow the road by which Herkhuf carried
home his pigmy, and Sabna his father’s body, until the brown rocks
meet the blue sky. To the south-west the second portion of the
highway, leading on to Aam, may be followed; but the point at which
it descends again to the river has not been identified though one
may safely say that the terminus,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_186">[186]</span> lay between Abu Simbel and the Second
Cataract. Here the country has a different aspect. On the west bank
of the Nile the sand lies thickly, and humps itself into low
hillocks covered with scrub. Between these one may walk in the cool
shade of groves of sunt and tamarisk, where flocks of goats stand
dreaming on the pathway and birds sing overhead. On the east bank
isolated hills of sandstone rise suddenly from the plain, and are
reflected in the river as in a flawless mirror. The land of Aam is
as beautiful as that of Arthet, though altogether different in
character.</p>

<p>The later history of the highway cannot be traced in much
detail. From the VIIth to the XIIth Dynasties the Egyptian
Government was seldom strong enough at home to attempt to look
after affairs abroad, and Lower Nubia relapsed into a state of
independence. Amonemhat, the founder of the XIIth Dynasty, about
2000 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>, was thus obliged to reconquer
the country; but his expedition seems to have travelled up the Nile
and not across the desert. A few reigns later a fortress was built
at the modern Anâybeh, in the land of Arthet, a few miles above the
terminus of the highway from Elephantine; and the road must now
have been used continuously as the express route from the city to
the fortress. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
stronghold is so much ruined and sand-covered that it has escaped
observation up till now, although its position had been ascertained
from inscriptions. Mention is made of a fortress named Taray, and
its distance from a certain known place is given, which exactly
locates it at Anâybeh. At about the same date a large fortress was
built on the west bank at the Second Cataract, and at the extreme
north end of the highroad the walls of Elephantine were now
strengthened.</p>

<p>Above the Second Cataract lay the land of Kush, and as
civilisation advanced southwards the territory of the Ghosts had
perforce to retreat before it. The Egyptians now knew that very
human negroes inhabited the country beyond Aam; but they could
still ask themselves in whispers what manner of bogies dwelt to the
south of Kush. While the immortals were falling back, however, the
mortals from above the Second Cataract were surely pushing forward.
The people of Aam were slowly being displaced by them, and in
consequence were hustling the tribes of Arthet. During the reign of
Senusert III. (1887 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>) the incursions
of the negroes of Kush assumed the proportions of an invasion, and
the Egyptians were obliged to wage an expensive and
lengthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span> war upon
them. When at last they were driven back beyond the Second
Cataract, the Pharaoh set up a boundary-stone there; and the words
which he ordered to be inscribed upon it show plainly enough what a
surprise it was to him to find that his enemies had possessed none
of those superhuman powers which his subjects had attributed to
them.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>“Why,” he says, “they are not a mighty people after all; they
are poor and broken in heart. My majesty has seen them; it is not
an untruth. I captured their women, I carried off their subjects,
went forth to their wells, smote their bulls. I reaped their grain,
and set fire thereto. I swear as my father lives for me I speak in
truth, without a lie therein coming out of my mouth.”</p>
</div>

<p>The last sentence tells of the king’s fear lest tradition should
conquer proven fact, and his soldiers should endow the negroes of
Kush with those mysterious powers of which their close proximity to
the Land of the Ghosts and the end of the world gave them the
use.</p>

<p>During the XVIIIth Dynasty (1580-1350 <span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span>) the highroad was used continuously both by the
troops which were being launched against the Sudân, and by the
officials who came to collect the taxes or to administer the laws.
Great changes had taken place since the old days.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> The Land of the Ghosts had
disappeared almost entirely from the geography, though still it
might exist somewhere above Khartûm. The people of Aam, now more
correctly called Emaam, had entirely absorbed Arthet, and Sethu had
fallen to the share of Wawat. Persons travelling by the highroad,
and descending to the river at Tomâs or near the Second Cataract,
found themselves in the sphere of influence of Emaam at either
place. One obtains some idea of the inhabitants of this once
mysterious land from a painting in the tomb of Huy, the viceroy of
the south, at Thebes. Here one sees a procession of negro princes
who have come to do homage to the Pharaoh’s representative. They
have evidently travelled by the highroad, for the Prince of Emaam
rides in a heavy chariot drawn by two bulls, while his retinue walk
behind him. A prince of Wawat is also shown; while the chieftains
of Kush are there in numbers, bringing with them the produce of
their country. Their clothes are more or less Egyptian in style,
and their wealth in gold is such as an Egyptian’s eyes might stare
at. In this sober, prosperous company one looks in vain for a sign
of that savage ferocity which made them the terror of
Elephantine.</p>

<p>In the XIXth Dynasty (1350-1205 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>),
when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> the armies of
Rameses the Great and his successors passed up to the wars in the
Sudân, the Elephantine road must have been one of the main routes
of communication. The name of Rameses the Great is writ large upon
the rocks of Tomâs, in contrast to the modest little records of
those infinitely greater men of the early days. Not so long
afterwards it was the people of the Sudân who were using the road
to march on Egypt, and soon the Egyptians were obliged to bow the
knee to a negro Pharaoh. Later, when they were once more the
masters of their own affairs, the tax-gatherers returned to Emaam,
and the names of some have been left on the road.</p>

<p>At this time Elephantine had become a city of considerable
wealth and importance. Splendid temples rose amidst the houses and
the trees, and fortified walls around the south end of the island
frowned down upon the swift river. Priests, soldiers, and nobles
walked the streets amongst the throng of the townspeople, or sailed
to and fro over the broken waters. At the foot of the western
hills, the bay from which the Nubian highway ran must have often
been the scene of the busy loading and unloading of pack-donkeys;
and at this time there may have been a masonry<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_191">[191]</span> landing-stage at the river’s edge to
terminate worthily the paved causeway.</p>

<p>Then came the Greeks and the Romans, and one may picture
perspiring legionaries hastening along the highroad to join
Petronius in his chase of the one-eyed queen Candace and her flying
Ethiopians. One may see the agents of Shems-ed-Dulah, the brother
of Saladin, passing along to rout out Christianity from Nubia; and
presently come the barbaric Mamelukes, driven before the armies of
Ibrahim Pasha. The last great scene in the long history of this
most ancient highroad was enacted a score of years ago. The
Dervishes,—the modern inhabitants of the Land of the
Ghosts,—marching on Egypt from the Sudân, picked up the road at the
Second Cataract, at its early terminus, and headed towards Tomâs.
An English force, travelling southwards, met and utterly defeated
them some seven miles back from the river, behind the village of
Tôshkeh, not far from Abu Simbel. And if one journeys direct from
the ancient land of Arthet to the land of Aam, the bones of the
dead and the <i>débris</i> of their camp will be found strewn to
right and left over the surface of the highway.</p>

<p>Travelling in Egypt one sees so many remains<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span> of the solemn religious
ceremonies of the ancient Egyptians, and reading at home one meets
with so many representations of the sacred rites, that it is a real
relief to come across some relic, such as this highroad, of human
energy and toil. In the courts of the temples one has pictured the
processions of the priests and the kneeling throng of the people.
One has heard in the imagination the rhythmic chants, has smelt the
heavy incense, and has seen the smoke of the sacrifice rising to
the roof. Glum Pharaohs have stalked across the picture, raising
their stiff hands to the dull gods; and rows of bedraggled
prisoners have been led to the sanctuary, roped in impossible
contortions. One has visited, or has read of, a thousand tombs; and
the slow funerals have passed before one in depressing array. But
here on this highroad over the western hills, where the north wind
blows free and the kites circle and call above one, where there
comes vigour into the limbs and ambition into the heart, these
relics of old adventures appeal with wonderful force. Here there
are no mysteries except the mystery of the land to the south, and
there are no prayers save the asking of a successful journey, and
the piling of four stones to the honour of the gods. One does not
pace through holy places whispering “How weird!” but
stick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> in hand, and
whistling a tune down the wind, one follows in the footsteps of the
bold caravan-masters of the past; and one thanks them from the
bottom of one’s heart for having played a man’s part on their page
of the world’s history to serve for all time as an example. When
the amusements of the luxurious hotels have given out, and the
solemnity of the ancient ruins has begun to pall, the spirits of
Herkhuf and of Sabna, of the captains and the caravan-conductors,
are always to be found waiting on the breezy hill-tops behind the
island of Elephantine, at the head of the Nubian highway.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
